## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher or Caesar Shift is a cipher which uses the alphabet in order to encode texts. The idea is to encode each letter with another letter in a "fixed" set of shifts.

Breaking a ciphertext is incredibly easy as there are only 25 possible "shifts" in the English alphabet.

## ROT13

ROT13("Rotate 13") is the same thing but a fixed shift of 13, this is a trivial cipher to bruteforce because there are only 25 shifts.

Generally, Caesar's Cipher and ROT13 are used in conjunction of other encryption methods to make the challenge more difficult!
