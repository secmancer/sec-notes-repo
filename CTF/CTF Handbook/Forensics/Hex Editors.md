- A hexadecimal (hex) editor (also called a binary file editor or byte editor) is a computer program you can use to manipulate the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file. The name “hex” comes from “hexadecimal,” a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined to form the file.
- Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called sector editors or disk editors. A hex editor is used to see or edit the raw, exact contents of a file. Hex editors may used to correct data corrupted by a system or application. A [list of editors](https://forensics.wiki/tools/#hex-editors) can be found on the forensics Wiki.
- Your hex editor should have two sections, the `hexadecimal` and `character` representations of that data. It's helpful to also have a "goto" feature in your hex editor to navigate large dumps of data.
