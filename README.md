# Security Notes
- A repo storing any notes I take cybersecurity related. It is organized based on the platform I am doing it based on.

## Credits
- I orignially put these very much messily together, but huge credit to ProjectNeo for their templates. I am now able to make them much cleaner!
- Check them out [here](https://github.com/Neosprings/ProjectNeo).
