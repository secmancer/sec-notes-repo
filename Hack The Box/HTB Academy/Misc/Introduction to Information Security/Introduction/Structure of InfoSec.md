### Intro
- We use and heavily rely on digital platforms for all sorts of tasks.
- This means that this data needs to be protected, which is where Information Security, or InfoSec, comes in.
- Goal: protecting information/systems from unauthorized people from doing actions like unauthorized viewing, changing, or destroying data.



### InfoSec Components
![InfoSec.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/293/InfoSec.png)
- `Client`: 
	- This is a PC/Laptop through which you access resources and services "on the Internet".
- `Internet`: 
	- This is a vast, interconnected network of servers that offer different services and applications, such as Hack The Box.
- `Servers`: 
	- Servers provide various services and applications designed to perform specific tasks.
	- For example, a web server might run on these, allowing you and others to view the content of this section on your computer or smartphone as you see it now. 
	- Servers provide various services and applications designed to perform specific tasks.
	- For example, one type of server might be a "web server", allowing you and others to view the content of a website (such as this section you're reading currently) on your computer or smartphone.
- `Network`: 
	- When multiple servers or computers are connected and can communicate with each other, it's called a network.
- `Cloud`: 
	- Cloud refers to data centers that offer interconnected servers for companies and individuals to use.    
- `Blue Team`: 
	- This team is responsible for the internal security of the company and defends against cyber attacks.
- `Red Team`: 
	- This team simulates an attack on the company. This team simulates an actual adversary/attack on the company.
- `Purple Team`: 
	- This team consists of both Blue Team and Red Team members working together to enhance the company's security.



### Castle Analogy
- Having understanding in InfoSec is super essential, especially with the digital landscape always digitally changing and adapting all the time.
- A good analogy is to think of having your information being treasured stored within a castle.
- The many aspects of the castle, like the walls, drawbridges, and guards are the security measures used to protect that treasure.
	- `The Treasure`: Your valuable data and information.
	- `The Castle Walls`: Firewalls, defensive mechanisms, and encryption that keep outsiders from getting in.
	- `The Guards`: Security protocols and access controls that monitor who enters and leaves.
	- `Penetration Testers`: Knights who test the castle's defenses by simulating attacks to find weak spots.
	- `Digital Transformation`: Expanding the castle to store more treasure, which attracts more thieves.
	- `Cyber Threats`: Thieves who are constantly looking for ways to breach the castle's defenses.
- Strengthening its defenses as it grows and becomes a more valuable target is essential to do.
- This all stems from how valuable information is during the digital age, with its uses and possible consequences for the misuse of this data.



### InfoSec Areas
- InfoSec help ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and available of data, but this can be done in several different, unique fields within the larger topic.
- This topics include, but not limited to what is listed below.
	1. Network Security
	2. Application Security
	3. Operational Security
	4. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
	5. Cloud Security
	6. Physical Security
	7. Mobile Security
	8. Internet of Things (IoT) Security



### Security Concepts
- Risk in information security is the potential for a malicious event to cause damage to an organization's assets, quantified by its likelihood and impact, encompassing both threats and vulnerabilities, and requiring mitigation measures to manage effectively.
- A threat is a potential cause of an incident that could harm a system or organization, whether from a person (e.g., hacker) or a natural event (e.g., fire), exploiting vulnerabilities to compromise security.
- A vulnerability is a weakness in a system, such as software bugs, misconfigurations, or weak passwords, that could be exploited by a threat, with the resulting potential damage constituting the associated risk.
