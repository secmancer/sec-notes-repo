### Overview
- **Definition**: Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts files on servers, computers, or networks, rendering them inaccessible.
	- **Attackers' Demand**: Victims must pay a ransom, often in cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin), to receive a decryption key.
	- **Analogy**: Like an art gallery where artwork is locked in cases with a ransom note demanding payment to access them, ransomware locks files until the ransom is paid.



### Key Elements
- **Primary Goal**: Financial gain for cybercriminals.
- **Targets**: Individuals, businesses, hospitals, governments, etc.
- **Beyond Financial Impact**:
    - Disruption of services.
    - Reputational damage.
    - Potential endangerment of lives (e.g., in healthcare).



### Process
- **Initial Access**:
    - **Method**: Typically via phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments disguised as trustworthy communications.
- **Infiltration and Encryption**:
    - Malware installs upon clicking/opening the link or attachment.
    - Encrypts files (documents, photos, databases) using complex algorithms, making data unreadable without a decryption key.
- **Demand for Payment**:
    - Victims are informed of encryption and given instructions to pay the ransom, often with a deadline.
    - **No Guarantees**: Payment doesn't ensure the attacker provides a working decryption key.
    - Victims who pay may become targets for future attacks.
- #### Case Study: WannaCry (2017)
	- Affected over 200,000 computers in 150+ countries.
	- **Impact**:
	    - UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals were locked out of patient records, leading to canceled surgeries and diverted ambulances.
	    - Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows systems without recent security updates.
	    - Caused billions of dollars in damages, emphasizing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.



### Impact
- **Operational Shutdowns**:
    - Businesses/services halted, potentially endangering lives (e.g., healthcare access).
- **Financial Loss**:
    - Costs beyond ransom payments:
        - Downtime and recovery.
        - New security implementations.
- **Data Loss**:
    - Permanent loss of critical information if backups are unavailable or compromised.
- **Reputational Damage**:
    - Erosion of trust.
    - Potential long-term revenue declines.
- **Perpetuation of Cybercrime**:
    - Paying ransoms encourages attackers to continue malicious activities.
    - Victims may be targeted again in the future.



### Analogy
- Imagine a library where all books are locked in cases requiring codes to unlock.
- A ransom note demands payment for the codes.
- **Ripple Effects**:
    - Affects students, researchers, and the community relying on the library's resources.
    - Ransomware has similar consequences, disrupting services and impacting dependent users.



### More Context
- **Global Impact**:
    - Ransomware can ripple across multiple sectors, affecting users far beyond the immediate victim.
- **Economic Scale**:
    - By 2025, the annual cost of cybercrime, including ransomware, is projected to reach trillions of dollars.
