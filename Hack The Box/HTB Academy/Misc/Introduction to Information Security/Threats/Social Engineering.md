### Overview
- Social engineering is a form of psychological manipulation where attackers deceive individuals into revealing confidential information or taking actions that compromise security. Unlike technical hacks, it exploits human trust and behavior.



### Significant Threat: Why is that?
- Targets the human element, often the weakest link in security.
- Can bypass robust technical safeguards by manipulating individuals.
- Relies on trust and the natural human tendency to assist others.



### Process
- Social engineering tactics exploit psychological vulnerabilities. Techniques evolve with technology and social norms, making them challenging to defend against.



### Common Techniques
1. **Phishing**:
   - Example: Fake emails from a bank urging account updates.
   - Goal: Obtain sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
2. **Pretexting**:
   - Example: Caller impersonating IT support to request login credentials.
   - Goal: Extract information or persuade actions using a fabricated scenario.
3. **Baiting**:
   - Example: USB drive labeled "Employee Salaries 2023" found in a parking lot.
   - Goal: Entice victims to install malware or compromise systems.
4. **Tailgating**:
   - Example: Gaining access to a secure building by asking someone to hold the door.
   - Goal: Enter restricted areas without proper credentials.
5. **Quid Pro Quo**:
   - Example: Offering a free software upgrade in exchange for login details.
   - Goal: Exchange a benefit for sensitive information or access.



### Impact
- Social engineering attacks can result in:
	- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
	- **Financial Losses**: Monetary damages through fraud or theft.
	- **Reputational Damage**: Loss of customer trust and long-term brand harm.
	- **Operational Disruption**: Compromised systems causing downtime.



### Defense Challenges
- Social engineering bypasses technological defenses by targeting human vulnerabilities.
- Employees, trusted to perform actions within their roles, can be manipulated.
- Even well-trained individuals are susceptible to skilled attackers.
