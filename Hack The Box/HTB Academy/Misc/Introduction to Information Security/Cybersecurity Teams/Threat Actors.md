### Overview
- **Threat Actor Teams**: Organized groups with specialized skills collaborating to carry out cyberattacks.
- **Red Teams**: Similar techniques but aimed at strengthening company security rather than harm.
- **Blue Teams**: Cybersecurity professionals defending against attacks.



### Team Composition
- **Expert Programmers**: Create custom malware exploiting system vulnerabilities.
- **Network Specialists**: Navigate digital infrastructures to identify weak points.
- **Social Engineers**: Use psychological manipulation to extract sensitive information.
- **Data Analysts**: Process stolen data for actionable intelligence (e.g., financial or trade secrets).
- **Team Leaders**: Coordinate, strategize, and oversee operations.



### Threat Actors
- **Lone Wolves**:
	- Operate independently with diverse skill sets.
	- Motivations: Personal interests, financial gain, ideological beliefs.
	- Capabilities range from basic phishing to advanced malware creation.
	- Often harder to detect due to autonomous methods.



### Analogies: Cybersecurity vs. Heists
- **Cyber Threat Actor Team vs. High-Security Bank Heist**:
	- **Scout**: Reconnaissance specialist gathers information on vulnerabilities, configurations, or habits.
	- **Lockpicker**: Exploits software/network vulnerabilities using hacking tools.
	- **Getaway Driver**: Exfiltration specialist extracts data or deploys ransomware while avoiding detection.
	- **Leader**: Strategizes, coordinates actions, ensures alignment of efforts.



### Tools/Techniques
- **Reconnaissance Specialist Tools**:
    - Network scanners, OSINT, social engineering.
- **Hacker Tools**:
    - Malware, rootkits, custom scripts.
- **Exfiltration Specialist Tools**:
    - Encrypted communication channels, VPNs, data obfuscation techniques.
- **Key Methodology**:
    - Favor "low and slow" methods to avoid detection over "noisy" tactics like brute force or overt malware.



### Objectives/Motivations
- **Primary Objective**: Infiltrate and exploit target systems/networks.
- **Motivations**:
    1. **Financial Gain**: Theft, fraud, selling data on the dark web.
    2. **Espionage**: Extract confidential information for strategic advantage.
    3. **Disruption**: Cause chaos via service shutdowns, data deletion, or misinformation.
    4. **Ideological Goals**: Promote causes (political, religious, social).
    5. **Revenge**: Retaliation for perceived wrongs.
