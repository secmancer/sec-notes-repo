### Overview
- **IoT Definition**: A network of everyday objects connected to the internet, enabling them to send and receive data.
    - Examples: Smart home devices, wearable fitness trackers, industrial sensors, connected cars.
- **Importance**: As IoT devices integrate into daily life, securing them is essential to protect personal information and ensure their proper functionality.
- #### IoT Security
	- **Definition**: Protecting interconnected devices, the data they handle, and the networks they operate on from unauthorized access, data theft, and other cyber threats.
	- **Challenges**:
	    - Limited processing power and memory in IoT devices, making advanced security difficult to implement.
	    - Large-scale deployment increases vulnerability.
	    - Compromise of a single device can lead to broader network access.
- #### Example Scenario:
	- A hacked smart thermostat could expose an entire home network, compromising personal files and sensitive information.
	- In industrial settings, compromised IoT devices controlling machinery could cause significant disruptions or physical harm.



### Players
- **Device Manufacturers**
    - **Role**: Architects and builders of IoT devices.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Design devices with security in mind (e.g., secure design principles, minimal unnecessary features).
        - Provide timely security updates to address vulnerabilities.
- **Network Administrators**
    - **Role**: Guards of the IoT network.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Secure IoT-connected networks using methods like network segmentation (compartmentalizing breaches).
        - Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor suspicious activities.
- **Application Developers**
    - **Role**: Ensure software interacting with IoT devices is secure.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Implement proper authentication for trusted user access.
        - Protect data using encryption and other security measures.



### Real-World Example
- **Incident**: A major retail chain's smart HVAC systems lacked proper security.
	- **Impact**: Hackers exploited the vulnerability to access the network, stealing millions of customers' credit card details.



### Future Challenges in the Field
- Rapid expansion of IoT introduces new device types with unique vulnerabilities.
- Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, developing innovative ways to exploit IoT systems.
