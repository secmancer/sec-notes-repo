### Overview
- Protecting hardware, facilities, and data storage devices from physical threats, such like theft, damage, and any unauthorized access.
- Analogy: Comparable to securing a candy store with locks, alarms, and guards to keep burglars out.
- Key elements include:
	- Protects sensitive information, expensive equipment, and personnel.
	- Integral to maintaining operational continuity and meeting regulatory compliance.



### Goals
- Deter potential intruders through visible security measures (e.g., fencing, signage).
- Detect unauthorized attempts to breach security (e.g., alarms, cameras).
- Delay intrusions to allow response (e.g., reinforced doors, barriers).
- Respond to threats effectively (e.g., security personnel, emergency protocols).



### Defense-in-Depth
- Layered approach with multiple protective measures ensures effective overall security.
- Some of these possible measures may include, but are not limited to:
	- Perimeter fencing.
	- Access control systems.
	- Reinforced doors.
	- On-site security personnel.



### Importance
- **Asset Protection**: Safeguards equipment and data from theft or damage.
- **Personnel Safety**: Protects employees and visitors within the facility.
- **Operational Continuity**: Prevents disruptions caused by breaches.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many industries require strict physical security measures.



### Responsibilities
- **Physical Security Team**:
    - Typically reports to a Chief Security Officer (CSO) or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
    - Collaborates with facilities management, IT, and HR departments.
- **Facilities Management Team**:
    - Ensures physical security measures (e.g., locks, lighting) are installed and maintained.
- **IT Security Team**:
    - Protects hardware and network equipment in collaboration with the physical security team.
- **All Employees**:
    - Must adhere to security protocols (e.g., not sharing access cards, locking doors).



### Vulnerabilities

| **Vulnerability**              | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unsecured access points**    | Doors, windows, or entry points left unlocked or bypassed.         |
| **Weak locks**                 | Low-quality or outdated locks that can be easily picked or broken. |
| **Inadequate perimeter**       | Lack of fencing, barriers, or surveillance around the facility.    |
| **Poor key management**        | Mismanagement of keys, access cards, or credentials.               |
| **Insufficient lighting**      | Dark areas that could conceal intruders.                           |
| **Exposed IT infrastructure**  | Servers or wiring left accessible to unauthorized individuals.     |
| **Lack of visitor management** | Weak monitoring and identification of visitors in secure areas.    |
| **Unattended workstations**    | Unlocked computers or devices left in accessible locations.        |



### Testing/Maintenance
- **Physical Penetration Testing**:
    - Conducted by Red Teamers who simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
    - Examples:
        - Bypassing access control systems.
        - Exploiting social engineering techniques.
        - Testing security cameras and personnel response times.
- **Ongoing Assessment**:
    - Evaluate and update locks, barriers, and protocols to counter evolving threats.
    - Train personnel on recognizing and addressing physical security risks.



### Roles
- **Confidentiality**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Integrity**: Protects against tampering or damage to systems.
- **Availability**: Ensures systems remain operational and accessible when needed.



### Relationship with Cybersecurity
- With poor physical security, even the most advanced cybersecurity measures are powerless again attacks leveraging it.
- Therefore, comprehensive information security strategies need to include robust physical safeguards.
