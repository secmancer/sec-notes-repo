### Overview
- Ensures organizational resilience during disruptions
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Restoring critical systems and data after catastrophic events.
- **Business Continuity (BC)**: Maintaining operations despite disruptions.



### Disaster Recovery (DR)
- Restores critical systems/data to minimize any downtime/data loss
- Scope:
	- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods).
	- Man-made disasters (e.g., fires, terrorist attacks).
	- Technological failures (e.g., system crashes, cyberattacks).
- Goal: resume essential functions quickly
- Typically, we include the following in our plan:
	- Data backup procedures.
	- System replication methods.
	- Failover strategies to alternate sites or cloud environments.
- Analogy: Similar to bringing an umbrella or a generator to a concert to quickly address rain or power outages.



### Business Continuity (BC)
- Ensures the continuous operation during and after a disruption
- Scope:
	- Broad contingency planning for business-wide processes.
	- Adjusting operations as needed (e.g., remote work, alternative suppliers).
- Goal: maintain operational integrity under adverse conditions
- Analogy: moving a concert indoors or switching to acoustic if technical setups fail



### DR/BC Importance
- Mitigates financial losses.
- Protects customer trust.
- Ensures regulatory compliance.
- Safeguards organizational reputation.
- Poor planning results in increased downtime, financial risks, reputational damage.



### Roles and Responsibilities
- Led by roles like Business Continuity Manager.
- Collaborate with IT, operations, and leadership.
- Responsibilities include:
    - Conducting risk assessments.
    - Identifying critical business functions.
    - Defining:
        - Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs): Maximum acceptable downtime.
        - Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs): Maximum acceptable data loss.
    - Designing recovery and continuity strategies.
- Penetration Testers: identify vulnerabilities in plans and test their robustness.



### Testing/Maintenance
- Ensures effectiveness/familiarity.
- Methods:
	- Tabletop Exercises: simulated walkthroughs of response scenarios
	- Full-scale Simulations: actual activation of fail-over systems
- Frequency:
	- Varies by organization size, complexity, and regulations
	- Annual testing is pretty common
