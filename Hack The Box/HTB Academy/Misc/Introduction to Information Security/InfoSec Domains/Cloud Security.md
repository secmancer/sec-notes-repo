### Overview
- Measures to ensure the safety of data and applications stored in the cloud, akin to securing valuables in a shared high-tech storage facility.
- Challenges:
	- Shared environment risks.
	- Reliance on cloud providers for infrastructure security.
- Shared Responsibility Model:
	- Cloud Provider: Secures the infrastructure (e.g., facility, guards, cameras).
	- Customer/User: Secures their data and applications (e.g., locking the storage unit).



### Potential Threats
- Data Breaches:
	- Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
	- Example: Someone picking the lock on your storage unit.
- Insecure APIs:
	- Flaws in access systems exploited by attackers.
	- Example: Security gaps in facility access systems.
- Misconfigurations:
	- Unintentionally exposed data due to improper settings.
	- Example: Forgetting to lock your storage unit.
- Account Hijacking:
	- Attackers stealing credentials to access data.
	- Example: Someone stealing your access card or code.



### Key Areas
- Data Protection:
	- Encrypting data at rest and in transit.
	- Example: Using strong locks and safes for valuables.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM):
	- Ensures only authorized individuals access resources.
	- Example: Personalized keys or codes for storage units.
- Network Security:
	- Securing pathways for data transmission.
	- Example: Monitored hallways and entrances in a facility.
	- Tools include firewalls and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
- Compliance and Governance:
	- Adhering to laws and industry standards.
	- Example: Prohibiting illegal items in the storage facility.



### Roles and Responsibilities
- Cloud Service Providers:
	- Manage the security of the infrastructure.
	- Ensure surveillance, secure access points, and general environment safety.
- Customer/User (Administrator):
	- Responsible for their data security.
	- Implement strong passwords, restrict user access, and maintain proper configurations.
- Security Teams:
	- Plan and oversee cloud security strategies.
	- Conduct risk assessments and address technical and human factors.



### Security Testing/Maintenance
- **Penetration Testing**:
    - Simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
    - Helps strengthen defenses against potential threats.
- **Ongoing Updates**:
    - Patch vulnerabilities and update security protocols.
    - Monitor for suspicious activities and educate users on best practices.
- **Proactive Approach**:
    - Regularly review and enhance security measures to counter evolving threats.
    - Example: Replacing old locks with new technology to counter advanced lock-picking tools.
