### Overview
- Network security protects networks from threats, similar to how we install a home alarm system to protect our homes.
- Additionally safeguards data/devices from both external and internal threats.



### Key Elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Firewalls**|Barriers between trusted internal and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic based on security rules.|
|**Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**|Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities, taking automated actions to detect or block threats.|
|**Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**|Provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring data privacy and integrity.|
|**Access Control Mechanisms**|Include authentication and authorization protocols to ensure legitimate user access.|
|**Encryption Technologies**|Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.|



### Similar Analogy
- We can make the comparison to a mail carrier, which puts integrity, confidentiality, and availability of mail to its highest. We need to do the same with our data.
- Like the mail carrier, we can have a ton of similarities:
	- **Uniform & ID Badge:** Authentication mechanisms.
	- **Locked Mailbag:** Firewalls.
	- **Vigilance:** Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
	- **Secure Courier Services:** VPNs.
	- **Tamper-Evident Seals:** Encryption technologies.



### Threats
- Types:
	- Financially motivated
		- Ransomware, data theft
	- State-sponsored espionage
	- Hacktivism
- Consequences:
	- Financial loss
	- Reputational damage
	- Legal liabilities
	- Operational disruptions
- Attack Surface:
	- Cloud computing
	- IoT devices
	- Vulnerabilities from remote work



### Responsibilities
- Primary: IT department, led by a Network Security Manager or similar, reporting to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
- Tasks:
	- Configure and manage devices
	- Develop and enforce policies
	- Monitor traffic and respond to incidents
- Testing:
	- Often performed by either penetration testers or ethical hackers
	- Goal: find vulnerabilities
	- Internal teams and/or external consultants are often used



### Stakeholders
- **CISO:** Oversees security strategy.
- **IT Management (CIO, IT Director):** Allocate resources and integrate security measures.
- **Network Administrators & Security Analysts:** Daily operations and monitoring.
- **Compliance Officers:** Ensure regulatory adherence.
- **Risk Management Teams:** Assess security investments and prioritize improvements.
