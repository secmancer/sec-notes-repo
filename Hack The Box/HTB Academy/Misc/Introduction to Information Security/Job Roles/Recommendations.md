### Overview 
- While InfoSec can be fun, it is also a large, and often intimidating field to be in, with tons of knowledge and skills flying around at once.
- Therefore, finding your footing and path quite quickly is a great way to navigate this minefield.
- Don't fuss to much where you start at, as there is no wrong direction to head into.
	- However, don't choose a direction just because someone else wants it, choose what speaks to you
- Another important detail is what you goal is.
- We need to ask ourselves questions, like these shown below.
	- Is it for the salary?
	- The skills?
	- The title?
- It really doesn't matter too much, but rather knowing exactly what you're doing or want to do it does matter. After all, that is what fuels the determination to push us forward.
- No matter the direction, we will be a very good specialist in areas we have the most interest in.
