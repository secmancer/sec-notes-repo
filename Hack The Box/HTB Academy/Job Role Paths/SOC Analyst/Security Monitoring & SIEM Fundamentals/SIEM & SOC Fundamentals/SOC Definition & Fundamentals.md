### **What is a SOC?**
- **Definition**: A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a dedicated team of information security experts that monitor and evaluate an organization's security status continuously.
- **Purpose**:
    - Identify, analyze, and address cybersecurity incidents.
    - Use technology (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR) and processes to safeguard against threats.
- **Team Composition**: Security analysts, engineers, and managers who collaborate with incident response teams to ensure prompt resolution of security concerns.
- **Processes**: Incident triage, containment, elimination, and recovery.
- **Role in Cybersecurity**: Offers continuous monitoring and response, reducing the impact of security breaches and minimizing future attack risks.



### **How Does a SOC Work?**
- Focuses on managing the operational aspect of enterprise security.
- Includes primary responsibilities like:
    - Monitoring, assessing, responding to, and reporting on cybersecurity incidents.
    - Advanced capabilities in forensic and malware analysis for deeper investigations.
- **Collaboration**: Works closely with the incident response team to maintain security posture.
