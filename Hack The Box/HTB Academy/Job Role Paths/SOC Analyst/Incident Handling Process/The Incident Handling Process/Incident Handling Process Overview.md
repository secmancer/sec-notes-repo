## Overview
- The incident handling process enables organizations to prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events.
- It is a cyclic process, meaning steps may be revisited based on new evidence.



## Key Activities
1. **Investigation**:
   - Identify the initial "patient zero" and construct a timeline for the incident.
   - Determine the tools and malware utilized by the adversary.
   - Document compromised systems and actions taken by the adversary.
2. **Recovery**:
   - Develop and execute a recovery plan.
   - Resume normal business operations if disruptions occurred.



## NIST Incident Handling Process: Four Stages
### 1. Preparation
- Improve readiness and defenses to anticipate potential malicious events.
- Enhance detection capabilities.
### 2. Detection & Analysis
- Detect and analyze malicious events.
- This stage requires continuous monitoring and ongoing improvements.
### 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- **Containment**: Isolate infected systems to prevent further spread.
- **Eradication**: Remove malware or threats from all affected systems.
- **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal business operations.
### 4. Post-Incident Activity
- Review the incident to extract lessons and improve organizational defenses.
- Create detailed reports to document the incident, its impact, and response.
## Process Considerations
- The process is not linear but cyclic; steps may change based on evidence.
- Each step must be completed before moving to the next.
  - Example: Fully contain all infected systems before proceeding to eradication.
- Ongoing preparation and detection must continue during response to avoid capability disruption.



## Key Takeaway
- Incident handling revolves around two primary activities: investigating and recovering. 
- Ensuring thoroughness and continuity in each stage is critical to minimizing the impact of malicious events.
