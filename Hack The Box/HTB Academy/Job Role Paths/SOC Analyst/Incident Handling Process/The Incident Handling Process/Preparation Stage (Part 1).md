## Overview
- Establish an incident handling capability within the organization.
- Protect against and prevent IT security incidents through protective measures such as:
    - Endpoint and server hardening.
    - Active Directory tiering.
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - Privileged Access Management (PAM).
- #### Key Point:
	- While protection is not the direct responsibility of the incident handling team, it is vital for their overall success.



## Preparation Prerequisites
- Ensure the following are in place:
	- **Skilled incident handling team members**: In-house or outsourced, but with basic incident handling knowledge in-house.
	- **Trained workforce**: Achieved through security awareness activities or training.
	- **Clear policies and documentation**.
	- **Tools**: Appropriate software and hardware for incident response.



## Policies & Documentation
- Maintain an up-to-date version of the following:
	- Contact information and roles of incident handling team members.
	- Contact details for legal, compliance, IT support, communications, law enforcement, and other key departments.
	- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures.
	- Incident information sharing policy and procedures.
	- Baselines for systems and networks (golden images, clean state environments).
	- Network diagrams.
	- Asset management database.
	- Privileged user accounts for incident response (enabled only during confirmed incidents and disabled post-incident with password resets).
	- Procedures for urgent hardware/software procurement without a lengthy process.
	- Forensic/investigative cheat sheets.



### Compliance & Legal Considerations
- Notify law enforcement and communicate externally (e.g., to customers) when required, such as in GDPR-related data breaches.
- Work with legal/compliance teams proactively to understand relevant regulations.



### Reporting Capability
- Document incidents during investigation with timestamps, actions, results, and responsible individuals.
- Answer key questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.



## Tools (Software & Hardware)
- Essential tools include:
	- Forensic laptops/workstations for team members.
	- Digital forensic image acquisition/analysis tools.
	- Memory capture and analysis tools.
	- Live response and log analysis tools.
	- Network capture/analysis tools.
	- Write blockers, hard drives, and hardware repair tools.
	- IOC creation/search capabilities.
	- Chain of custody forms and encryption software.
	- Ticket tracking system.
	- Independent incident handling system.
	- Secure investigation facility.



### Jump Bag
- A ready-to-use bag with necessary tools to respond immediately, avoiding delays.



### Communication Security
- Use a documentation system independent of the organization's infrastructure.
- Assume domain-wide compromise; conduct communications through external, secure channels.



## Questions
