### Overview
- Incident handling has become an integral part of an organization's defense against cybercrime. 
- While measures exist to prevent or reduce security incidents, IH is essential for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Incident handling involves structured procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment. It encompasses:
	- Intrusion incidents
	- Malicious insiders
	- Availability issues
	- Intellectual property loss



### Key Concepts
- **Event**: Any action occurring in a system or network, e.g.:
  - Sending an email
  - Mouse click
  - Firewall allowing a connection request
- **Incident**: An event with negative consequences, such as:
  - System crash
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
  - Natural disasters or power failures
- **IT Security Incident**: Events with a clear intent to cause harm, e.g.:
  - Data theft
  - Funds theft
  - Unauthorized data access
  - Usage of malware or remote access tools



### Importance
- Protects personal and business data from compromise.
- Mitigates impacts ranging from localized device issues to widespread environmental compromise.
- Facilitates systematic and effective responses through trained incident response teams.



### Prioritization
- High-severity incidents require immediate attention and resource allocation.
- Lower-severity incidents also need initial investigation to confirm their nature.



### Role of the Incident Manager
- Leads the incident handling team.
- Commonly assigned to a SOC manager, CISO/CIO, or third-party vendor.
- Acts as the single point of communication during the investigation.
- Coordinates activities, tracks progress, and ensures timely response.
