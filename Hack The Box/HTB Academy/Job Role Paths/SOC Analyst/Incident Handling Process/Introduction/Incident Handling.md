### Incident Handling Definition & Scope
- IH is crucial for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability in organizations, with some handling it in-house and others relying on third-party providers.
- **Event**: A system or network action, such as sending an email, a mouse click, or a firewall allowing a connection.
- **Incident**: An event with negative consequences, like a system crash or unauthorized data access.
- **IT Security Incident**: An event with the intent to cause harm, such as data theft, unauthorized access, or malware installation.
-  Incident handling involves a set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents, not just intrusions but also issues caused by insiders, availability problems, or intellectual property loss.
- A comprehensive plan should cover various incident types and provide measures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them.
- Events may not immediately be recognized as incidents, so suspicious events should be treated as incidents until proven otherwise.



### Incident Handling's Value & Generic Notes
- **Importance of Quick Response**
    - IT security incidents often involve compromised personal and business data, making quick and effective response crucial.
    - The impact of incidents can range from a few devices affected to large-scale environment compromise.
    - An incident handling team (or incident response team) responds systematically, minimizing data theft or service disruption through investigation and remediation.
    - Decisions made before, during, and after an incident will impact its overall consequences.
- **Incident Prioritization**
    - Incidents should be prioritized based on severity, with high-priority incidents receiving immediate attention and resources.
    - Lower-severity incidents may still need initial investigation to determine if they qualify as security incidents.
- **Incident Management**
    - The incident handling team is led by an incident manager, often a SOC manager, CISO/CIO, or trusted third-party vendor.
    - The incident manager has the authority to direct employees and track activities and statuses during the investigation.
- **Guidelines and Resources**\
    - NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide provides widely-used practical guidelines for responding to incidents effectively and mitigating risks.
