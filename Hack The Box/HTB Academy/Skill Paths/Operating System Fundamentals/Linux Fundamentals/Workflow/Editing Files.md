    - Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around.
- **Search**:
    - Press `[CTRL + W]` to search for text within the file.
- **Saving**:
    - `[CTRL + O]` saves the file. You can confirm the filename and save it by pressing `[ENTER]`.
- **Exiting**:
    - `[CTRL + X]` exits Nano. If you haven't saved your changes, it will prompt you to save before quitting.
- Nano is straightforward and great for beginners. It's especially useful for quick edits without needing advanced features.



### **Vim Editor**
- Vim is a more powerful but complex text editor, often favored by power users for its efficiency.
- **Modes**: Vim has multiple modes that allow you to interact with text in different ways:
    - **Normal Mode**: This is the default mode where you issue commands. You can move the cursor, delete text, copy, and more.
    - **Insert Mode**: In this mode, you can type text directly into the document.
    - **Visual Mode**: You can highlight text to perform operations like cut, copy, or replace.
    - **Command Mode**: Press `:` to enter commands such as `:w` (write/save) or `:q` (quit).
    - **Replace Mode**: You overwrite existing text as you type.
    - **Ex Mode**: For executing a series of commands.
- **Starting Vim**:
    - Just type `vim` or `vim <filename>` to open a file. In Normal mode, you can navigate and manipulate the text. For example:
        - Press `i` to enter Insert mode and start typing.
        - Press `ESC` to return to Normal mode.
        - Type `:w` to save, and `:q` to quit.
        - If you need to quit without saving, type `:q!`.

    - This is an excellent resource to get familiar with Vim’s commands. You can start it by typing `vimtutor` in the shell. It takes you through basic and advanced features of Vim, making it easier to learn as you practice.
- Vim has a steep learning curve, but once you master it, it can greatly increase your editing speed and flexibility.
