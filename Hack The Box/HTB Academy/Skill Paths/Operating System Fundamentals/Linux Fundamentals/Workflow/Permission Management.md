### Introduction
- Under Linux, permissions are assigned to users and groups. 
- Each user can be a member of different groups, and membership in these groups gives the user specific, additional permissions. 
- Each file and directory belongs to a specific user and a specific group. So the permissions for users and groups that defined a file are also defined for the respective owners. 
- When we create new files or directories, they belong to the group we belong to and us.
- When a user wants to access the contents of a Linux directory, they must first traverse the directory, which means navigating to that directory, requiring the user to have `execute` permissions on the directory. 
- Without this permission, the user cannot access the directory's contents and will instead be presented with a â€œ`Permission Denied`" error message.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l

drw-rw-r-- 3 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   4096 Jan 12 12:30 scripts


cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -al mydirectory/

ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/script.sh': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/..': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/subdirectory': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/.': Permission denied

-????????? ? ? ? ?            ? script.sh
d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? subdirectory
```
- It is important to note that `execute` permissions are necessary to traverse a directory, no matter the user's level of access. 
- Also, `execute` permissions on a directory do not allow a user to execute or modify any files or contents within the directory, only to traverse and access the content of the directory.
- To execute files within the directory, a user needs `execute` permissions on the corresponding file. 
- To modify the contents of a directory (create, delete, or rename files and subdirectories), the user needs `write` permissions on the directory.
- The whole permission system on Linux systems is based on the octal number system, and basically, there are three different types of permissions a file or directory can be assigned:
	- (`r`) - Read
	- (`w`) - Write
	- (`x`) - Execute
- The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /etc/passwd

- rwx rw- r--   1 root root 1641 May  4 23:42 /etc/passwd
- --- --- ---   |  |    |    |   |__________|
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |        |_ Date
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |__________ File Size
|  |   |   |    |  |    |_______________ Group
|  |   |   |    |  |____________________ User
|  |   |   |    |_______________________ Number of hard links
|  |   |   |_ Permission of others (read)
|  |   |_____ Permissions of the group (read, write)
|  |_________ Permissions of the owner (read, write, execute)
|____________ File type (- = File, d = Directory, l = Link, ... )
```



### Change Permissions
- We can modify permissions using the `chmod` command, permission group references (`u` - owner, `g` - Group, `o` - others, `a` - All users), and either a [`+`] or a [`-`] to add remove the designated permissions.
- In the following example, let us assume we have a file called `shell` and we want to change permissions for it so this script os owned by that user, becomes not executable, and set with read/write permissions for all users.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l shell

-rwxr-x--x   1 cry0l1t3 htbteam 0 May  4 22:12 shell
```
- We can then apply `read` permissions for all users and see the result.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chmod a+r shell && ls -l shell

-rwxr-xr-x   1 cry0l1t3 htbteam 0 May  4 22:12 shell
```
- We can also set the permissions for all other users to `read` only using the octal value assignment.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chmod 754 shell && ls -l shell

-rwxr-xr--   1 cry0l1t3 htbteam 0 May  4 22:12 shell
```
- Let us look at all the representations associated with it to understand better how the permission assignment is calculated.
```shell-session
Binary Notation:                4 2 1  |  4 2 1  |  4 2 1
----------------------------------------------------------
Binary Representation:          1 1 1  |  1 0 1  |  1 0 0
----------------------------------------------------------
Octal Value:                      7    |    5    |    4
----------------------------------------------------------
Permission Representation:      r w x  |  r - x  |  r - -
```
- If we sum the set bits from the `Binary Representation` assigned to the values from `Binary Notation` together, we get the `Octal Value`. 
- The `Permission Representation` represents the bits set in the `Binary Representation` by using the three characters, which only recognizes the set permissions easier.



### Change Owner
- To change the owner and/or the group assignments of a file or directory, we can use the `chown` command. 
- The syntax is like following shown below.
- #### Syntax - chown
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```
- In this example, "shell" can be replaced with any arbitrary file or folder.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown root:root shell && ls -l shell

-rwxr-xr--   1 root root 0 May  4 22:12 shell
```



### SUID & SGID
- Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. 
- Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. 
- The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`". 
- When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.
- It is often the case that administrators are not familiar with the applications but still assign the SUID/SGID bits, which leads to a high-security risk. 
- Such programs may contain functions that allow the execution of a shell from the pager, such as the application "`journalctl`."
- If the administrator sets the SUID bit to "`journalctl`," any user with access to this application could execute a shell as `root`. 
- More information about this and other such applications can be found at [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/journalctl/).



### Sticky Bit
- The **sticky bit** in Linux is a file permission used for directories, adding security by controlling who can delete or rename files within the directory.
- It is commonly applied to shared directories to ensure only the **file owner**, **directory owner**, or **root user** can delete or rename files.
- When a sticky bit is set, the directory permissions show a **`t`** or **`T`** in the execute permission:
    - **`t`**: Sticky bit with **execute permission**, allowing users to access and execute files.
    - **`T`**: Sticky bit without **execute permission**, preventing users from viewing or running files.
- Example permissions:
    - **`rwxrwxrwt`**: Sticky bit with execute enabled (lowercase `t`).
    - **`rwxrwxrwT`**: Sticky bit without execute enabled (uppercase `T`).
