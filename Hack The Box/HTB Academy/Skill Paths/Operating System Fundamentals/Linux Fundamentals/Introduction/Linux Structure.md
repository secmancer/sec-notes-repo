### History
- The **Linux kernel** originated from the **Unix OS** (1970), with key events including the release of **BSD** (1977) and Richard Stallman's **GNU project** (1983), aiming to create a free Unix-like OS.
- **Linus Torvalds** started the **Linux kernel** as a personal project in 1991, which evolved into a major OS with over **23 million source code lines**, licensed under the **GNU GPL v2**.
- **Linux** is available in over **600 distributions** (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora) and is widely used in **servers**, **desktops**, and **embedded systems**.
- **Linux** is considered more **secure**, **stable**, and **performance-efficient** compared to other OS, but can be more challenging for beginners and has fewer **hardware drivers** than **Windows**.
- As an **open-source** OS, Linux is **free** to modify and distribute. It powers various devices, including **Android**, **servers**, **mainframes**, and more.
- Linux is an **operating system** that manages hardware resources and supports multiple distributions, similar to **Windows** or **macOS**.
- The **Pwnbox**, a customized version of **Parrot OS** (a Debian-based distribution focused on security and privacy), is used in modules for practical cybersecurity tasks.
