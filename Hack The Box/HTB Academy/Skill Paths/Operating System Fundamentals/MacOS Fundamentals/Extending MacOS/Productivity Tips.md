### Introduction
- Most operating systems, including macOS, are designed with built-in productivity tools to enhance user efficiency.
- Productivity tools significantly impact our ability to work efficiently, both in professional and daily tasks.
- While opinions on the most important productivity tools vary, certain features are essential for any productivity workflow.
- macOS offers built-in applications for many of these essential tools and features, making them readily accessible to boost productivity.
- Leveraging these built-in tools and features can streamline tasks and improve overall workflow.

> **Note:** While this section focuses on macOS and some of the discussed tools are macOS-only, many of the concepts discussed in this section should be generally useful when using any device or operating system, and so should help you in boosting your productivity on any device. If a discussed tool or feature is macOS-only, you may try to find alternatives for the operating system you use.



### Device Switching
- As we work, it is in our best interest to use a single device instead of jumping from one device to another so we don't get distracted by notifications and messages on other devices.
- One of macOS's key productivity features is [Continuity](https://www.apple.com/bh/macos/continuity/), which enables us to do just that by bringing everything on our iPhones/iPads to our macOS system and allowing continuous use between multiple Macs, making it seamless to work between various Apple devices.
- Here are some of the Continuity features we may consider using.

### Time Management
- As we take on multiple projects or responsibilities, our time fills up, leading to stress and a feeling of being constantly occupied.
- Effective time management, particularly through time blocking, can reduce this pressure and help maintain focus on individual tasks.
- Time blocking involves scheduling specific periods for tasks, such as sub-tasks of larger projects or study sessions, to ensure dedicated focus.
- For example, if we need to complete a training course, we can allocate blocks of time in our calendar, like every weekend between 12 PM and 5 PM.
- Adding tasks to our calendar makes us more likely to follow through, as it's easier to commit to scheduled activities than relying on memory alone.
- The macOS `Calendar` app is a great tool for time management, offering features like color-coded calendars and iCloud syncing across devices.

> **Tip:** macOS and iOS also have a feature called [Focus Modes](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl613dc43f/mac), which can be accessed from the `Control Center` on macOS. This allows us to focus on specific tasks and avoid other distractions by only allowing notifications from specific apps or even customizing our work environment when in Focus mode.



### Reminders
- A crucial aspect of productivity is using a **to-do list** or **reminders** for tasks that aren't tied to specific times or durations.
- Personally, I use reminders for shorter, straightforward tasks that don’t require time blocking, such as daily activities or routine chores.
- For example, reminders can be set for tasks like taking medication, paying bills, or renewing licenses. These are tasks that typically take 15-30 minutes, and using time blocking for them would overwhelm the calendar and reduce focus.
- The **macOS Reminders** app is perfect for managing such tasks, offering features like multiple reminder groups and iCloud syncing across devices.
- To consolidate reminders and calendar events in one place, an app like [**Fantastical**](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) can be helpful. It integrates both the calendar and reminders apps, allowing for easy management across devices.
- Fantastical offers a free version with basic features, and a paid subscription unlocks more advanced functionalities.



### Note Taking
- To boost productivity, it's important to keep notes on various aspects of our life, such as annual goals, progress tracking, checklists (e.g., grocery or bucket lists), book summaries, and project drafts.
- Notes can also be used to track progress alongside calendars and reminders, making them an essential productivity tool.
- macOS has a built-in **Notes** app that supports fundamental features like text formatting, checklists, tagging, and syncing across Apple devices via iCloud.
- Recent updates to the Notes app have introduced new features, such as **Quick Notes**, which can be accessed by moving the cursor to the bottom right of the screen for quick note-taking.
- The app also supports **handwriting recognition** for notes taken with an Apple Pencil or iPhone touchscreen.
- Notes can be shared for real-time collaboration, with read/write access privileges for shared users.



### Cloud Storage
- Portable hard drives once played a crucial role in storing and backing up critical data, but they posed risks of data loss if lost or corrupted.
- Today, cloud storage offers a reliable alternative, allowing access to files across devices at any time, significantly enhancing productivity by ensuring data availability anywhere.
- **iCloud Drive**, built into all macOS systems, syncs data across Apple devices, making it a convenient option for cloud storage.
- Other cloud storage services, such as **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **Dropbox**, are also available for use.



### Multitasking
- When working with multiple applications on macOS or any other operating system, it's important to manage them efficiently to easily switch between tasks and view multiple apps at once.
- A key feature for window management is **Full Screen** mode.
- Clicking the **green button** in the top-left corner of any macOS app puts it in full-screen mode.
- Once in full-screen, you can switch between different apps using a **three-finger swipe** left or right on the trackpad or the **CTRL+←**/**CTRL+→** shortcuts.
- Hovering over the green button gives you options to display two apps side-by-side in full screen, which is useful for multitasking.
- **Full screen** may be sufficient for many users, but for those with super-wide monitors or who need more than two apps open, third-party window management apps like **Moom**, **Magnet**, or **BetterSnapTool** can enhance productivity by letting you snap windows into different screen portions.
- **Stage Manager**, introduced in macOS 13, further improves window organization by grouping apps and windows in a single view, making it easier to switch between different tasks.
