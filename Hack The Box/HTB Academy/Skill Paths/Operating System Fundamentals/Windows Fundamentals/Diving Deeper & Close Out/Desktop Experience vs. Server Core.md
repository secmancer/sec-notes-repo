- **Windows Server Core Overview:**
    - Released with **Windows Server 2008** as a minimalistic server environment.
    - Lacks a GUI, offering lower management requirements, smaller attack surface, and reduced disk and memory usage.
- **Supported Features:**
    - Management via **command-line**, **PowerShell**, or **remote management** (MMC/RSAT).
    - Supports some graphical tools like **Registry Editor**, **Notepad**, **Task Manager**, and Sysinternals tools (e.g., Process Explorer, TCPView).
- **Installation and Configuration:**
    - As of **Windows Server 2019**, users select **Server Core** or **Desktop Experience** at installation, with no option to switch afterward.
    - **Sconfig** is used for initial setup and common administrative tasks (networking, updates, account management, etc.).

- **Server Core Limitations:**
    - Certain server applications **cannot run** on Server Core, such as:
        - **Microsoft Server Virtual Machine Manager 2019 (SCVMM)**
        - **System Center Data Protection Manager 2019**
        - **SharePoint Server 2019**
        - **Project Server 2019**
- **Key Considerations:**    
    - **Server Core** is lighter, more resource-efficient, but has a **steeper learning curve** and fewer GUI management tools.
    - The choice between **Desktop Experience** and **Server Core** should depend on **business needs**, **server purpose**, and **administrator skill level**.
- **Application Compatibility:**
    - There are differences in available applications between Server Core and Desktop Experience. This list includes common applications but is not exhaustive.
