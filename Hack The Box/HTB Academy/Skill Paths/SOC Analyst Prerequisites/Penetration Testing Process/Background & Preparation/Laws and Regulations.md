### USA
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**: Prohibits unauthorized computer access and activities like hacking and malware distribution. Criticized for its broad definitions and lack of clarity, which could criminalize legitimate security research. Understanding the CFAA is crucial to avoid unintended legal violations.
- **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**: Prohibits circumventing digital copyright protections (e.g., encryption, digital locks). Even for research, violating these provisions can lead to penalties. Researchers must ensure their work complies with the DMCA.
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)**: Regulates the interception and storage of electronic communications. Protects privacy by requiring consent for monitoring or accessing communications and restricting service providers from sharing message content.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Governs electronic personal health information, requiring safeguards like encryption and compliance with institutional policies. Researchers must ensure data security and adhere to HIPAA to avoid severe penalties.
- **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**: Regulates the collection of personal information from children under 13. Researchers must take special precautions to avoid non-compliance, which can result in legal and financial penalties.

### Precautionary Measures during Penetration Tests
- We have prepared a list of precautions we highly recommend following during each penetration test to avoid violating most laws.
- In addition, we should also be aware that some countries have additional regulations that apply to specific cases, and we should either inform ourselves or ask our lawyer.
