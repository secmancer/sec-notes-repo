- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**
    - PoC in project management demonstrates a project's feasibility, based on technical or business criteria, and guides further actions, including securing a network by confirming vulnerabilities.
    - In information security, PoC proves that a security issue exists, allowing developers and administrators to validate, reproduce, and test remediation efforts.
    - PoC can be documented vulnerabilities or practical scripts/code that automatically exploits the vulnerabilities to show the flaw.
    - A script-based PoC is useful, but administrators may focus on defeating the script without addressing the underlying vulnerability. It's crucial to emphasize that the vulnerability can be exploited in other ways.
    - Reports should present the broader security issues, provide remediation advice, and include an attack chain to demonstrate how multiple flaws can combine and affect the system.
    - Emphasizing the root cause of security flaws, such as weak passwords due to poor policies, is essential for long-term solutions. Administrators and developers should focus on improving system and application standards.
