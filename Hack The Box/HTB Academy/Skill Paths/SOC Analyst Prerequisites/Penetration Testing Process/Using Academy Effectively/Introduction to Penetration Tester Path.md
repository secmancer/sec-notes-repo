### Introduction
- **Introduction to Penetration Testing Path**
    - This module serves as an introduction to the Penetration Tester Job Role Path, covering the phases of penetration tests and providing an overview of the process.
    - Itâ€™s a great starting point for newcomers to HTB Academy or the penetration testing field.
- **Target Audience and Path Overview**
    - Designed for both aspiring penetration testers and experienced professionals looking to upskill.
    - Covers key areas like External Penetration Tests, Internal Penetration Tests (network and Active Directory), and Web Application Security Assessments.
- **Hands-On Learning Approach**
    - The path emphasizes hands-on experience through all stages of penetration testing, from reconnaissance to reporting.
    - Modules explore the "why" behind tactics and tools, drawing on real-world security assessment experiences.
    - Completing the path equips students with the skills and mindset necessary for basic to intermediate penetration testing.



### HTB Academy Learning Philosophy
- **Goal and Methodology**
    - The focus is on teaching students to view both sides of an issue and identify flaws others may miss.
    - Students are encouraged to create a repeatable and thorough methodology for any assessment type, regardless of environment or industry.
    - Through hands-on examples and skills assessments, students build "muscle memory" for common tasks, allowing for deeper insights during assessments and better client value.
- **Learning Philosophy**
    - Emphasis on "learn by doing," with a risk-based approach to learning.
    - Focus on the "why" behind vulnerabilities, covering discovery, exploitation, remediation, detection, and prevention.
    - Aims to create well-rounded professionals who can provide tailored, ethical, and legally sound security advice to clients and employers.



### Ethical and Legal Considerations
- **Legal and Ethical Boundaries**
    - Penetration testing is unique in that it allows actions that would typically be illegal, but only during authorized testing periods.
    - Practice techniques in controlled, legal environments like HTB labs to avoid crossing legal lines.
    - Scanning or interacting with an organization's systems without explicit written consent is illegal.
    - Always get written consent (Scope of Work, rules of engagement, contract) before testing.
- **Bug Bounty Programs**
    - Bug bounty programs (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd) provide opportunities for legal, hands-on testing.
    - Familiarize yourself with the program's rules before engaging in testing.
    - These programs typically prohibit automated scanning, focusing on manual testing skills.
- **Due Diligence in Penetration Testing Jobs**
    - Ensure that the company you're working for has explicit written agreements in place with clients.
    - Criminal organizations may pose as legitimate companies, so verify everything in writing (scope of work, testing details).
- **Testing Principles**
    - Always work within the defined scope, and seek written consent for any potential scope changes.
    - Be mindful of the potential impact of tools and exploits; prioritize client safety and avoid disruption.
- **Ethical and Legal Conduct**
    - Maintain professionalism, trust, and transparency in all testing activities.
    - Avoid abusing the trust clients place in you; always work ethically and legally.
    - Document everything, especially compliance and approval processes, to ensure clarity and protection.



### Penetration Tester Path Syllabus
- The path simulates a penetration test against the company Inlanefreight broken down into various stages, covering the core concepts and tools that will make us stand out as penetration testers. 
- The path culminates in an in-depth module on critical soft skills such as notetaking, organization, documentation, reporting, and client communication, and then a full-blown mock penetration test to practice all of our skills in one large, simulated company network.

- After completing this path, we recommend that students work towards a specialization, be it Active Directory, Web, or Reverse Engineering. 
- We should slowly continue to build our skills in all areas to become as well-rounded as possible while striving for expert-level knowledge in at least one discipline.
- For those that may not yet feel confident enough to take on this Job Role Path, we recommend working through all of the modules in the `Information Security Foundations` [Skill Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/paths), which will help build the prerequisite knowledge necessary to be successful in the Penetration Tester path.
- It is best to take the modules in the Penetration Tester Path in order, as the concepts build on each other.
- Throughout the path, we continually reiterate concepts and present things in different ways to give students more practice and scenarios to further their knowledge in a particular area. 
- For example, Lateral Movement and Pillaging are vital skills to succeed as a penetration tester. We do not have separate modules for each of these phases because pillaging and lateral movement can be thought of as iterative processes that we will revisit many times during an assessment. 
- Instead, we introduce tactics, techniques, and procedures for moving laterally and show a wide variety of scenarios where we can benefit from strong pillaging/post-exploitation skills.
- The following section breaks down 36 different HTB Academy modules and how they fit into each phase of the penetration testing process.
