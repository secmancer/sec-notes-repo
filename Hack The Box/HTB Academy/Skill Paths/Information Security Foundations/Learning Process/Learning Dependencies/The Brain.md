### Introduction
- Familiarizing ourselves with the brain helps us understand its role in learning and how its structure influences our learning process.
- The brain is always active, contrary to myths claiming we use only 5-10% of its capacity. Studies using EEG and fMRI confirm this.
- The speed of learning does not determine intelligence, as brain regions responsible for complex logical tasks develop fully around age 20 (+/- 2).
- Individual differences in brain development explain why people excel in some areas but struggle in others (e.g., Einstein's slow math learning but later brilliance).
- Learning changes the brain physiologically, as seen in individuals with strong technical skills but social deficits.
- Despite limited understanding of how the brain works, we have developed methods with proven effects on brain function, which will be explored further.
- Cognitive science studies conscious and subconscious processes, including abilities like memory, language, and problem-solving, though the nature of thought remains unproven and non-material.



### The Theory of Thought
- **Definition of Thought**:
    - Thought is described as an individual process of action/reaction to internal or external influences, where information is interpreted and linked internally based on personal methodology developed throughout one's lifetime.
- **Example**:
    - Learning Scotland has 421 words for "snow" triggers a reaction (surprise) to external information, interpreted and linked to prior knowledge (e.g., Scotland, snow, words).
- **Associations in Memory**:
    - Thoughts are linked through association chains stored in neuronal networks, forming connections between related information.
- **Continuous Brain Activity**:
    - The brain is constantly active, producing thoughts both consciously and subconsciously during waking and sleeping phases.
- **Conscious vs. Subconscious Processing**:
    - The Libet Experiment suggests that conscious experiences and decisions are delayed compared to underlying neuronal processes, highlighting the role of subconscious thought.



### Conscious Thoughts
- Our consciousness is also a very complex topic with many views and definitions. 
- Also, this has not yet been researched enough to say how it works in detail. 
- We do not need to know every detail for our purposes in this field to benefit from it. 
- However, we should understand what we are talking about when we talk about conscious and subconscious. 
- For us, however, the following definition is sufficient for the description of human consciousness:
	- `Consciousness describes the totality of all those mental processes by which we become aware of the external and our internal world with active observation. Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looking at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and intentionally look elsewhere, we are in consciousness.`



### Unconscious Thoughts
- Psychology knows another level of consciousness, the so-called subconscious. 
- Thoughts that arise in our subconscious, we do not perceive superficially. 
- What we do perceive are emotions. 
- Emotions reflect the way we think subconsciously. 
- We process far more thoughts subconsciously than consciously.
- Nevertheless, subconscious thoughts influence what we do. 
- Studies have shown, among other things, that the subconscious mind has already made a decision 30 seconds before we become aware of it. 
- One of the first people to study the subconscious mind was Sigmund Freud, who lived about 100 years ago.
- Part of Libet's experiments showed that the difference between conscious and unconscious experiences could depend on the duration of brain activity. 
- In these experiments, subjects were given stimuli to the ascending sensory pathway in the thalamus. 
- For example, the subjects saw two lamps, each of which was illuminated alternately for one second. 
- Subjects were asked to say which of the two lamps was lit when the stimulus was administered. 
- If the stimulus lasted for less than half a second, they did not consciously perceive the stimulus. 
- However, even if they did not consciously perceive a stimulus, the subjects were asked to guess which lamp was lit while the stimulus was administered. 
- This showed that even if the subjects were not consciously aware of the stimulus, they guessed correctly much more frequently than at random (50 percent). 
- When the stimulus lasted 150 to 260 milliseconds, the subjects guessed correctly 75 percent of the time.
- For the test subjects to perceive the stimulus consciously, the stimulus had to last 500 milliseconds.
