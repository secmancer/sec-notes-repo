### **The Brain: Key Facts**
1. **Myths About the Brain**:
   - **Myth 1**: We only use 5-10% of our brain.
     - **Reality**: The brain is always active in all regions, as shown by EEG and fMRI studies.
   - **Myth 2**: Learning speed determines intelligence.
     - **Reality**: Brain regions for complex logical tasks develop around age 20 (±2 years). Development varies by individual.
     - Example: Einstein struggled with math in school but later excelled.
2. **Brain Development and Learning**:
   - Different brain regions develop at different rates.
   - Example: A computer nerd may excel in technical skills but struggle socially due to uneven brain region development.
3. **Cognitive Science**:
   - Studies conscious and subconscious processes.
   - Key cognitive abilities: memory, language, perception, problem-solving, mental will.
   - **Thought**: Not yet proven to be material; remains a mystery.



### **The Theory of Thought**
- **Definition**: A thought is an individual process (action/reaction) to internal or external influences, where information is interpreted and linked based on personal experiences.
  - Example: Hearing "Scotland has 421 words for snow" triggers surprise, imagination, and linking to known knowledge (associations).
- **Associations**: Thoughts form chains of linked information (e.g., Scotland → Snow → 421 → Words).
  - These associations are stored in neuronal networks and form the basis of memory and problem-solving.



### **Conscious vs. Unconscious Thoughts**
1. **Conscious Thoughts**:
   - **Definition**: Mental processes that make us aware of the external and internal world through active observation.
     - Example: Actively deciding to look away from a monitor full of text.
   - **Key Feature**: Intentional and observable.
2. **Unconscious (Subconscious) Thoughts**:
   - **Definition**: Thoughts processed below the level of conscious awareness.
     - Emotions reflect subconscious thinking.
   - **Influence**: Subconscious decisions occur ~30 seconds before conscious awareness.
   - **Libet’s Experiment**:
     - Stimuli lasting <500ms are not consciously perceived but still influence behavior.
     - Example: Subjects guessed correctly 75% of the time for stimuli lasting 150-260ms, even without conscious awareness.



### **Key Takeaways**
- The brain is complex and always active, with different regions developing at varying rates.
- Learning speed ≠ intelligence; individual brain development varies.
- Thoughts are processes of interpreting and linking information, forming associations.
- Conscious thoughts involve active observation, while subconscious thoughts influence behavior without direct awareness.
- Understanding these processes can enhance learning and problem-solving strategies.



### **Applications**
- **Learning**: Leverage associations and practice to strengthen memory and problem-solving.
- **Decision-Making**: Recognize the role of subconscious thoughts in shaping actions.
- **Creativity**: Use conscious and subconscious processes to generate innovative solutions.
