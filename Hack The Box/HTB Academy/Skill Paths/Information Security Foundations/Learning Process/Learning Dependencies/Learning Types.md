### Introduction
- The Learning Pyramid can be represented in many different ways. 
- It describes the learning efficiency of different types of practice.



### Passive Learning
- If we follow the Learning Pyramid while going through the modules just by reading, we will learn only about `10%` of the whole penetration testing experience. 
- By watching some demonstrations, we will not learn more than `30%`.



### Active Learning

> How do we empty a bottle of water? We turn the bottle around and let it flow, right? Why didn't we try to create a vortex by turning the bottle around the Y-Axis? By creating a vortex, we let oxygen flow into the bottle regularly, and the water can flow out without closing the bottle opening.

- The same thing happens with learning. 
- If we learn too much without taking breaks, we will get stuck.

> "So, how many breaks do we need and how long should they be?"

- This is a question that we must answer on our own because only we know what effects and consequences our actions will have on us.
- However, what happens when we get stuck? 
- There are many ways that we become "stuck". 
- It could be that we focused too much and lost the context of the task at hand, or we are tired and did not take enough breaks. 
- Solving a problem like this requires `creativity`.
- In penetration testing, it is essential to pay attention to details that appear unimportant at first glance. 
- If we look back, we will see some terms printed in **bold** and `green`, and if we take a closer look, we will see that they have an essential meaning in the process. 
- Here it is crucial to train the eye to notice even the most minor details. 
- All our knowledge and experiences are based on associations that connect us with different perceptions, such as colors and smells, for example, through different situations, known to us as memories. 
- These will be recalled later either actively or passively.
- This process also only takes place in the course of practice.
- In the next step, we will see how important it is through a small practical example.

> Optional Exercise
> 
> Collect as much information as possible about creativity and problem-solving. Put all the information together and create an overview. Find the best way for us to think creatively.
