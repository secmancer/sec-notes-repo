### 1. **Limitations and Assumptions**
   - **No Explicit Limitations**: The exercise didn’t impose any restrictions, yet we often self-impose constraints.
   - **Why Didn’t We Think Differently?**
     - We defaulted to conventional problem-solving methods.
     - We didn’t consider alternatives like adding more digits or changing arithmetic operations.




### 2. **The Hacker’s Mindset: "Outside the Box"**
   - **Definition**: Thinking creatively and challenging assumptions to find unconventional solutions.
   - **Why It Matters**: In information security, rigid thinking can limit problem-solving and innovation.



### 3. **Understanding Our Current Thinking**
   - **Root Cause**: Our education and experiences often condition us to follow predefined rules.
   - **Example**: Solving `20 * ________ + ________ = 65535` using traditional arithmetic without considering alternatives.
   - **Goal**: Identify and break free from mental constraints to develop a hacker’s mindset.




### 4. **Optional Exercise: Reflecting on Limitations**
   - **Why Didn’t We Change Arithmetic Operations?**
     - We assumed the operations were fixed.
     - We didn’t question whether the problem allowed for flexibility.
   - **Why Didn’t We Add More Digits?**
     - We assumed the equation’s structure was rigid.
     - We didn’t explore creative interpretations of the problem.
   - **Detailed Reflection**:
     - Write at least 200 words analyzing why you stuck to conventional methods.
     - Explore how self-imposed limitations hindered creative problem-solving.



### Key Takeaways:
1. **Challenge Assumptions**: Don’t accept problems at face value; question constraints.
2. **Embrace Creativity**: Explore unconventional solutions, even if they seem outside the norm.
3. **Self-Reflection**: Understand your current thinking patterns to identify areas for growth.
4. **Develop a Hacker’s Mindset**: Cultivate the ability to think "outside the box" for innovative problem-solving.
