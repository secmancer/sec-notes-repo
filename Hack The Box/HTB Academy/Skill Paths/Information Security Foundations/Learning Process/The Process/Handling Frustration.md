- **Frustration and Its Sources**:
    - **Frustration** is an emotional response to unmet expectations, desires, or situations. It often manifests as feelings of **disappointment** or **powerlessness**. These feelings can arise from two primary sources:
        - **External Influences**: For example, negative feedback or criticism from others, especially authority figures like superiors.
        - **Internal Frustration**: This stems from **self-imposed expectations** or **subconscious thought patterns**, where we expect things to unfold in a particular way but are unable to control the outcome.
- **Subconscious Thoughts and Feelings**:    
    - Our emotions are often a reflection of **subconscious thoughts** and internal processes. Many people aren’t fully aware that their frustration is tied to **unconscious thoughts**. A helpful way to gain clarity is by listening to your thoughts as if they were being expressed by a third party, like a best friend. This perspective allows for greater objectivity, making it easier to understand the source of frustration and process it more rationally.
- **Frustration Tolerance**:
    - Everyone has a different level of **frustration tolerance**, which refers to how well someone can handle frustrating situations before reacting emotionally or giving up. People with low frustration tolerance are more likely to **quit** or **become overwhelmed** when faced with resistance or unmet goals, which can lead to increased stress or avoidance behaviors.
    - **Frustration tolerance** can be developed and strengthened over time. You’ve likely observed someone stay calm in a stressful situation, and this ability comes from a higher level of frustration tolerance. Factors contributing to this tolerance include past experiences, coping strategies, and mental resilience.
- **Training Frustration Tolerance**:
    - Understanding where frustration tolerance originates is key to improving it. Some people naturally handle stress better than others, but anyone can train themselves to become more resilient to frustration. Developing a **growth mindset**—where challenges are viewed as opportunities to learn rather than obstacles—can be an effective way to build frustration tolerance over time.

> Imagine that you have to catch a train. To catch it in time, we are forced to run about 2 miles quickly. We take all excuses and changes out of the situation for this example ("Think Outside the Box") and determine that you have no other choice in this example. We will be sweaty, maybe we will even get a bit dirty and out of breath, and maybe we will even miss our train because it came too early for once. 
> Furthermore, now let us change the situation a little bit and imagine that you consciously decide to leave the house too late and run fast to catch the train.

- **Frustration as a Temporary Emotion**:
    - The key takeaway here is that **frustration is temporary**. When we experience it, it may feel intense, but it will eventually fade. In the example of missing the train, once we accept the situation and stop focusing on external factors (like blaming the train or the timing), we can **shift our attention** to how we react. This shift is crucial because our reaction is within our control, whereas external events are often not.
- **Embracing Frustration without Fear**:
    - Many people react with panic, aggression, or avoidance when confronted with frustration. This is because they perceive frustration as something to fear or something that could overwhelm them. However, by **reminding ourselves that frustration is a passing emotion**, we can **reduce its grip** on us. Knowing that frustration doesn’t last forever allows us to remain **calm** and **rational**, even when facing challenging situations.
- **The Power of Controlled Responses**:
    - Over time, by repeatedly putting ourselves in controlled, frustrating situations, we will **develop resilience**. We will not only become **calmer** in the face of frustration, but we will also **build self-confidence** in our ability to handle stress. The more we handle frustration consciously and with control, the more we realize that it doesn’t have to dictate our actions.
- **Internal vs External Frustration**:
    - **Internal frustration** is the frustration we can control, such as our reactions, thoughts, and emotional responses. As we develop frustration tolerance, we can better manage these internal feelings.
    - On the other hand, **external frustration**—like missing the train or dealing with delays—cannot be controlled. We can’t change the actions of others or predict every circumstance, but we **can choose how we respond** to those external factors. Learning to accept that external factors are beyond our control helps us **focus on the aspects that we can influence**.
