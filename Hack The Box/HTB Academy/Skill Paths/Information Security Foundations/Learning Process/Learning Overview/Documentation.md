- **Objective**: Present information clearly and reproducibly to facilitate understanding and replication of activities.



### Essential Characteristics of Documentation
1. **Overview**: Provide a high-level summary of the content.
2. **Structure**: Organize information logically for easy navigation.
3. **Clarity**: Ensure the content is easy to understand and free from ambiguity.



### Tools for Documentation
- **CherryTree**: A recommended tool for organizing and documenting information.
- **FlameShot**: A tool for capturing and editing screenshots, enhancing clarity with visual aids.



### Guidelines for Effective Documentation
1. **Empathize with the Reader**: Design documentation with the readerâ€™s perspective in mind.
2. **Avoid Repetition and Ambiguity**: Keep content concise and clear.
3. **Simplify Readability**: Ensure the documentation is easy to follow and understand.



### Preparing Customer-Focused Documentation
- **Identify Key Points**: Clarify the most important aspects for the customer before creating documentation.
