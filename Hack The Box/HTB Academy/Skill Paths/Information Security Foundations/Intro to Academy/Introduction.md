### Welcome to HTB Academy
- Overall Goal: have a streamlined and `highly interactive` learning environment that allows us to have fun
- Uses `guided learning` approach to allow you to practice what you learn throughout the modules, that will contain many `hands-on exercises` to teach what will be covered along with providing challenges to build a much greater understanding
- This is mostly done with something called a `Skills Assessment`, which tests what you learned overall in the module within a small, real-world scenario
