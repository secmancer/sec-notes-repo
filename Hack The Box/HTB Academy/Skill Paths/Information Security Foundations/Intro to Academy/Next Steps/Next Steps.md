### Pick a Path
- We highly encourage students to always follow a specific path in their learning journey.

- This skill path will prepare you for your first HTB certification regardless of your current level.
- If you `have some experience in cyber security`, and would like to obtain your first HTB Certification, then we suggest enrolling in one of our intermediate job role paths, depending on your job/field preference, as shown below.
- If you are experienced in cyber security, and would like to get advanced in a specific field, then we suggest you enroll in one of our advanced job role paths, like the `Senior Web Penetration Tester` to become an `HTB Certified Web Exploitation Expert`, or the `Active Directory Penetration Tester`.
- HTB Academy will keep pushing more modules, paths, and certifications, so keep an eye out for our upcoming content.
