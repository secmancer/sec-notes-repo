### What is a Path
- They are a collection of modules that share a broader topic. Paths may share the same modules at a time. 
- Some are designed for earning a `HTB Certification` after completing their corresponding `exam`. 

### Type of Paths
- Two types: `Skill Paths` and `Job-Role Paths`. 
- You can enroll in any path by clicking the `Enroll` button.
- Then, you can easily track progress on the path along with any upcoming modules within it on the [Dashboard](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard) page.

> **Note:** Enrolling in a path does not unlock all of the modules within it. Hence, enrolling in a path does not cost any cubes.

- `Skill Path`: designed for a specific popular skill that students may want to learn. 
	- For example, the `Operating System Fundamentals` path teaches you the basics of different operating systems.
- `Job-Role Paths`: curated for a specific job role in the cyber security market. 
	- These are linked to an HTB Certification, which requires passing a multi-day practical exam to obtain.

> **Tip:** You can estimate how long a path will take to complete by checking the duration mentioned underneath the path's title. This represents the sum of the `estimated time for completion` of each module in the path "in 8-hour work days".


### Obtaining a Certification
- Through the Job-Role paths, you are able to earn [HTB Certifications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/exams) after completing the path and passing the exam.

> **Note:** Completing a path also unlocks a new badge, and so does obtaining a certificate.
