### Types of Sections
- Two types: `Theory Sections` and `Interactive Sections

- `Interactive sections` allow you to learn through practical examples and demos, along with being `highly encouraged to re-apply what you learned` as well.

### My Workstation
- A workstation, or what they call the PwnBox, which is an instance of Parrot OS, is provided for you for each exercise
- It allows you to `re-do any examples` as well as `solve any exercises or skills assessments`.
- You can spawn it by clicking the `Start Instance` button and/or in the `My Workstation` box on the right of your screen.


### Completing a Section
- Clicking on the `Mark Complete and Next` button allows you to complete any section.
- If mandatory questions exist, then those must be solved first to complete it.
- Questions may be skipped for later, but are required to finish the module, so make sure you do solve them at some point.
### Questions
