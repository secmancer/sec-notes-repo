### Types of Modules

- Completing modules requires paying a certain amount of cubes, and then rewarding 20% of those cubes back to us after completion.
- Tier 0 are the only modules that reward and cost the same amount of cubes (hence, is technically free)

> **Note:** If you have an annual subscription, then included modules will cost you 0 cubes, while still giving you back their reward.
