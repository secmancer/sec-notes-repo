### What is an Exercise?
- In addition to the examples and demos demonstrated within interactive sections, most also end with exercises to test that knowledge.
- Exercises allow us to test our knowledge within a section, using either a  `Docker target` or `VM target(s)`. Exercises give us authentication and access details every time to help us access our machine.

> **Note:** Only a single target per user can be active at any one time. Each target has a timer that shows how much time is left before it is terminated, but it can be manually extended or re-spawned by clicking on the appropriate buttons.


### Exercise Targets
- Commonly, targets use the Docker container engine for easily spawning and accessible machines to use. Many can often be accessed outside of the AttackBox/your pentesting VM.
- More complex/advanced machines may use a virtual machine (VM) as their target. These take longer to spawn and setup. These require use of the AttackBox/your pentesting VM.

> **Notes:** 
> - You can spot a docker target by its lack of a VPN button, as no VPN connection is required to access it.

### Completing an Exercise
- Hints may be provided for some questions to aid you in the right direction if you struggle
- After inputting your answer/flag, clicking the Submit button allows you to submit your work and see if you got it right, and reward the proper amount of cubes (if applicable)
- Most questions are required to complete the section, however, optional questions may exist, and these are marked often with the ability to view their answer.

> **Note:** You can always use the exercise targets to practice what was shown in the section. However, solving the exercise will not always match the exact commands shown in the section, as they will have some variance to test your understanding and gradually build your skills. Exercises in easier modules will have a minor variance from the shown demo, while harder modules will be more challenging.

### Questions
- Start the above target, copy the shown IP:PORT by clicking on them, and then paste them in your browser. What's the proof shown in the page?
