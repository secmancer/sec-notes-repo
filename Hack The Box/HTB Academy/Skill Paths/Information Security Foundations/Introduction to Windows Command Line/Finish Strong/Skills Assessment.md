- During a penetration test with our team, we were instructed to collect some information for a non-critical Windows host. Our team has recently gained access to this host, which contains many users. For the team to focus on more complex tasks, we have been asked to take a closer look at this host. The main focus is on finding user names and passwords. This should enable us to examine the system in such a way that we can find out and document all user passwords.
- Each question has a corresponding `user` with whom you will need to authenticate to complete the questions. In each challenge, you may be asked to perform specific actions, use specific executables, or find information on the host to get the flag for that question.
- In most instances, the flag for the previous user must be used as the SSH password for the following user (i.e., the flag for user2 is the password for user3 to SSH in, and so on).
- If you wish, play around and see if you can find multiple ways to achieve the same output as you got earlier from each question. Do not forget to `document` your one-liners, scripts, or general notes on how you went about finding specific information.
