### Briefing
- Our current company was hired by Inlanefreight to perform an external and internal penetration test.
- Proper OS preparation needs to be done before we start with the test.
- For this test, we are provided with internal systems that need to prepared so that the engagement can go over smoothly.
### Penetration Testing Stages & Situations
- Each penetration test differs in scope, environment, and objectives based on the client’s infrastructure and requirements. Activities vary depending on the type of test, which can expand or restrict the working environment and tools used.
- Internal penetration tests typically involve an internal host, often with internet access, requiring a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to download tools and resources. 
- Remote testing may involve shipping a pre-configured device, using a custom virtual machine (VM), or accessing the client’s network via VPN or IP whitelisting.
-  For on-site assessments, having updated Linux and Windows VMs is critical. Linux supports specific tools, while Windows VMs simplify tasks like Active Directory enumeration. Preparation ensures efficient testing and adaptability to client needs.
- Penetration testers must be versatile and fully prepared with appropriate tools to provide comprehensive assessments. Testing often requires adjusting tools or downloading scripts to address unique network challenges and ensure effective evaluations from the start.


### Setup & Efficiency
- We will gather different experiences/tools over time, as we discover and get familiar with more and more of them.
- Having structure is very important, as it allows for peak efficiency during penetrating testing, as taking time to get all of our stuff together during the test may waste unnecessary time.
- However, while it does require some significant preparation, knowledge, and work of different operating systems into building a good toolbox, it's overall something absolutely worth doing.
