- A VPS is an isolated environment created on a physical server using virtualization technology, part of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions.
- It provides all the benefits of a dedicated server, including resource allocation, management freedom, and flexibility in OS and application choice.
- A VPS is similar to a Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS), offering functionalities comparable to dedicated servers but using shared hardware.
- VPS acts as a middle ground between inexpensive shared hosting and the more costly dedicated server rentals.
- It enables web hosts to offer comprehensive functions at manageable costs by virtualizing systems on shared hardware, ensuring isolation for each VPS.
- Common use cases for VPS include web hosting, development/testing environments, running critical applications, and more.
