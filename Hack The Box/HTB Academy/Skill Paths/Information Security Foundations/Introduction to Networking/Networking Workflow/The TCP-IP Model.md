- The `TCP/IP` model is also a layered reference model, often referred to as the `Internet Protocol Suite`. 
- The term `TCP/IP` stands for the two protocols `Transmission Control Protocol` (`TCP`) and `Internet Protocol` (`IP`). 
- `IP` is located within the `network layer` (`Layer 3`) and `TCP` is located within the `transport layer` (`Layer 4`) of the `OSI` layer model.

- With `TCP/IP`, every application can transfer and exchange data over any network, and it does not matter where the receiver is located. 
- `IP` ensures that the data packet reaches its destination, and `TCP` controls the data transfer and ensures the connection between data stream and application. 
- The main difference between `TCP/IP` and `OSI` is the number of layers, some of which have been combined.
