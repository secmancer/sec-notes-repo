### Getting Help on Hack The Box (HTB)
- When working on Hack The Box (HTB) challenges, getting stuck is a common and expected part of the learning process. Below are some tips on where to get help and how to ask or provide assistance effectively while following HTB's rules.



### **1. HTB Help Resources**
- #### **HTB Forum**
	- Each box has a dedicated **official discussion thread** for players to:
	    - Share insights.
	    - Discuss hints or tactics without providing spoilers.
	- **Best Use:** For working on retired boxes or challenges, read threads for helpful hints while avoiding step-by-step guides.
- #### **HTB Discord**
	- Join the **Official HTB Discord Server** [here](https://discord.com).
	    - Access various discussion channels covering:
	        - **Boxes and Challenges**.
	        - **Academy Modules**.
	        - **Hacking and Pentesting**.
	    - Stay updated on news, tournaments, and community events.
	- **Tip:** Always read the **Server Rules** to ensure respectful and compliant participation.

	    - Troubleshooting VPN issues.
	    - Technical help with tools or setup.
	- If unresolved, raise a **support ticket** with HTB:
	    - Disable adblockers to see the chat bubble for submitting a ticket.



### **2. Asking Questions Effectively**
- When seeking help, craft your question to maximize the likelihood of receiving useful guidance.
- #### **Include the Following Details:**
	1. **Where You're Stuck:**
	    - Are you stuck at gaining **user**, **root**, or solving a specific challenge?
	2. **Steps You've Taken:**
	    - Detail the enumeration, tools, or exploits you've tried.
	3. **Where You're Failing:**
	    - Explain the specific error, unexpected behavior, or hurdle.
	4. **Attempts to Resolve:**
	    - Share what research or troubleshooting you've done.
- #### **Example of an Effective Question:**

> "I’m stuck on the _Nibbles_ box. I’ve enumerated the webserver and found the `/admin` portal, but my attempts to brute-force login are being blacklisted. I’ve tried checking for default credentials and hints in the source code but haven’t found anything useful. Am I missing something obvious?"

- **Why This Works:**
	- It's specific and explains the issue.
	- Demonstrates prior effort.
	- Invites helpful hints rather than a direct solution.
- #### **Avoid:**
	- Being vague (e.g., “How do I root Nibbles?”).
	- Asking for direct spoilers or walkthroughs.



### **3. Answering Questions Effectively**
- When assisting others, ensure your guidance aligns with HTB's rules and fosters learning.
- #### **Best Practices:**
	1. **Avoid Spoilers:**
	    - Do not reveal specific commands, paths, or solutions.
	2. **Provide Hints, Not Answers:**
	    - Share general advice to nudge others in the right direction.
	    - Example: "Have you checked the source code for comments? Sometimes they hide useful hints."
	3. **Share Resources:**
	    - Recommend tools, blog posts, or documentation that helped you.
	4. **Offer Encouragement:**
	    - Remind others that persistence and iteration are part of the process.



### **4. Building Community Connections**
- Helping others benefits you as well:
	- **Strengthens Understanding:** Explaining concepts reinforces your knowledge.
	- **Builds Teamwork:** Collaborating with others can prepare you for team-based challenges.
	- **Enhances Your Profile:** Active participation in the community can showcase your skills.



### **5. Summary Tips**
- Always respect **HTB Rules**: Avoid spoilers and maintain a collaborative spirit.
- Be specific and detailed when asking for help or giving advice.
- Use official resources like the **HTB Forum**, **Discord**, and **FAQ** for guidance.
- Approach each challenge as a learning opportunity rather than simply solving for points.
- By actively engaging with the HTB community and leveraging available resources, you’ll develop your technical skills and foster a supportive network of peers.
