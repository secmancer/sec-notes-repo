### Forum
- The [Hack The Box Forum](https://forum.hackthebox.com) is a great place to get help on boxes, challenges, and academy material.
### Discord
- Another great place to get similar help as well, along with getting news about the platform, new content, and announcements about upcoming events.
- Be sure to read the rules and follow them to ensure there are no issues

### Asking Questions Effectively
- If we are stuck, we may ask a question by one of these means.
- To get the best help possible, we need to lay out our problem in an effective matter.
- Therefore, we must provide in our question:
	1. What point of the box/challenge are we stuck at 'i.e., user/root'?
	2. What steps have we taken so far to get to the point we are at?
	3. What step are we failing at, and what have we done to resolve our issue?
	4. Always try to be very specific on what we need help on, rather than asking for general help
- This list may help us in actually finding the answer to our question more quickly, but also allows other users to have a better idea what is going on, and therefore, willing to provide something that may solve our issue.
- Always take things from a learning perspective, and just simplying finding the answers
- Don't give away any spoilers for your machine.
- Be a bit vague in your description to help aid with this.

### Answering Questions Effectively
- On the opposite end, we may also be able to answer someone's question as well
- Remember that being involved in the community also builds connections as well, so it's highly recommended to help out others when you are able to.
- To effectively help someone, you need to:
	1. Be as spoiler-free as possible, and do not get direct instructions on how to complete the current step or the entire box
	2. Give minor hints or tips that can lead to the right direction for completion, and do not give entire suggestions for completion
	3. Share resources that we found helpful
	4. Share tips on points we were getting stuck on

### Getting Technical Help
- The official [HTB FAQ](https://help.hackthebox.com), has very detailed and helpful articles in solving these type of issues
-  If we can't find what we are looking forward, we are always free to submit a  [ticket](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/) with HTB Support.
