### Beginner’s Guide to Starting in Information Security
- #### **Learning Approaches**
	1. **Guided Learning (e.g., HTB Academy)**
	    - Structured, step-by-step modules covering specific topics.
	    - Includes hands-on exercises and assessments.
	    - Benefits:
	        - Builds foundational knowledge in a structured way.
	        - Encourages understanding through practical exercises.
	2. **Exploratory Learning (e.g., HTB Platform)**
	    - Users encounter real-world scenarios with little prior guidance.
	    - Challenges include reverse engineering, cryptography, steganography, forensics, and more.
	    - Benefits:
	        - Encourages independent problem-solving.
	        - Develops technical and critical thinking skills.
- **Tip**: Mix guided and exploratory learning to build a strong foundation and challenge your understanding.
