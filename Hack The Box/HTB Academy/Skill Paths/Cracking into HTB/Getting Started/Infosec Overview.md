### Introduction
- [Information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), or more shorten to InfoSec, is quite a large field, with many specializations available, like:
	- Network and infrastructure security
	- Application security
	- Security testing
	- Systems auditing
	- Business continuity planning
	- Digital forensics
	- Incident detection and response
- Overall, it's the practice of securing data from any unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use and disruption and those actions taken to reduce those.
- Data can be physical or electronically stored, and even tangible (design blueprints) or intangible (knowledge).
- It's our job to ensure "confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data". We commonly call this the `CIA triad`.

### Risk Management Process
- Data protection focuses on efficient, but effective policy implementation with little to no effects on an organization's business operations and productivity. 
- Achieving this involves creating/following a process called the `risk management process`.

- The core tenet of infosec is maintaining the `CIA` of data and ensuring it's not compromised in any way, shape, or form when an incident occurs. 
- An incident could be anything, from a natural disaster, to a system malfunction, to a security incident.


### Red Team vs. Blue Team
- In infosec, we have the terms `red team` and `blue team`.
- Red teamers play an adversary role or attacking role.
	- They focus on breaking into the organization to find potential weaknesses real attackers may utilize to break the organization's defenses. 
	- The most common task is penetration testing, social engineering, and other similar offensive techniques.
- Blue teamers play the defensive role, and make up the majority of infosec jobs.
	 - They are responsible for building up an organization's defenses by analyzing risks, creating policies, responding to threats and incidents, and effectively using security tools and other similar tasks.


### Role of Penetration Testers
- Security assessors, like network penetration testers, web application penetration testers, and red teamers helps identifies risks in external and internal networks. 
- This may include network or web application vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, misconfigurations, or issues that could lead to reputational harm. 
- Good testers work with clients to identify risks to their organization, provide information on how to reproduce these risks, and guidance on mitigating them identified during testing.
- Assessments can take many forms, it ultimately depends on what the organization's main goals are.
- A deep understanding of the risk management process is needed for anyone starting in information security.
