### **Next Steps on Hack The Box (HTB)**
- Now that we’ve completed the module, here’s a structured roadmap to advance your penetration testing skills, build an information security portfolio, and make the most of the HTB platform.



### **1. Boxes & Challenges**
- #### **Start with Retired Boxes:**
	- **Root a Retired Easy Box:**
	    - Choose an easy-rated retired box.
	    - Use the official walkthrough or video guide (VIP membership required) to root the box.
	    - **Tip:** Watch a walkthrough, then replicate the steps without referring to the guide unless you get stuck.
	- **Complete a Retired Medium Box:**
	    - After mastering Easy boxes, move to Medium boxes. These typically require deeper technical knowledge.
	    - Focus on learning new tools and methodologies.
- #### **Tackle Live Boxes:**
	- **Root Your First Live Box:**
	    - Choose an Easy box with a difficulty rating of 1–3.
	    - Use community hints (forum, Discord) if needed, but try to avoid walkthroughs.
	    - **Tip:** It’s normal to struggle with your first live box. The key is persistence.
	- **Build Confidence:**
	    - Aim to complete 5–10 Easy and Medium retired boxes to strengthen your skills before tackling more challenging live boxes.



### **2. Guided Learning**
- #### **Expand Knowledge Through Academy Modules:**
	- Use HTB Academy to cover areas where you feel less confident.
	- Modules provide structured learning on key topics like enumeration, privilege escalation, and specific exploit techniques.
	- **Tip:** Maintain a "To-Do" list of Academy modules you want to complete.
- #### **Combine Guided and Exploratory Learning:**
	- Use guided modules for foundational knowledge.
	- Use exploratory learning (boxes/challenges) to apply and deepen your understanding.



### **3. Giving Back to the Community**
- #### **Answer Questions:**
	- Return to the help channels (Forum, Discord) where others may be stuck on boxes you’ve completed.
	- Provide hints, share resources, or encourage better enumeration while avoiding spoilers.
- #### **Write and Share Walkthroughs:**
	- Document your process for rooting retired boxes.
	- Publish thorough and detailed walkthroughs for recently retired boxes.
	- **Tip:** Use this as an opportunity to practice report writing—a critical skill for penetration testers.



### **4. Suggested HTB Goals**
- Here’s a progression list to keep you motivated:

|**Goal**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Root a Retired Easy Box**|Start small with guidance from walkthroughs.|
|**Root a Retired Medium Box**|Advance your skills with slightly more challenging boxes.|
|**Root an Active Box**|Solve live boxes without full walkthroughs.|
|**Complete an Easy Challenge**|Tackle one-off challenges (e.g., cryptography, web, steganography).|
|**Share a Walkthrough**|Publish your notes for a retired box.|
|**Complete Academy Modules**|Expand foundational knowledge on weaker topics.|
|**Root Medium/Hard Live Boxes**|Build confidence and tackle challenging boxes on your own.|
|**Complete a Track**|Work through curated Tracks on specific topics.|
|**Win Battlegrounds Battle**|Participate in team-based HTB battles.|
|**Complete a Pro Lab**|Explore simulated enterprise environments for advanced pentesting practice.|



### **5. Way Forward**
- **Consistency is Key:**
    - Dedicate regular time to boxes, challenges, or modules.
    - Track your progress to measure improvement.
- **Embrace Challenges:**
    - Progress through increasingly difficult tasks to solidify your skills.
- **Never Stop Learning:**
    - Stay updated with new techniques, tools, and vulnerabilities.
    - The moment you stop learning, you stop growing.
