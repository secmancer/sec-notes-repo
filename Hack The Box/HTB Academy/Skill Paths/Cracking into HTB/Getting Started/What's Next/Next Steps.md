-  Finishing this module, we are now ready to start taking on more boxes and challenges!

### Boxes & Challenges
- We can now create some more ambitious goals after feeling the water with the box in the module.
- It's recommended to try retired boxes, as they often are a great challenge, while also having documentation and media to help you when you are stuck.

> Note: Provided writeups are only with the VIP membership on HTB Labs

> Tip: Try to watch a video walkthrough of the box, and then try to replicate what you learned without following the video step-by-step. In case you get stuck, you can refer to the walkthrough again.


### Keep on Learning
- We will still stumble upon many difficult topic areas in boxes and challenges, which may result in the creation of gaps within our knowledge
- Therefore, we need to keep working on HTB Academy modules in these areas to improve and build upon these skills and confidence.
- For more effective learning, it's recommended to have our own approach with guided learning, like the Academy Modules, to become a more well-rounded.

> Tip: Try to build a list of modules you are interested in, and add them to your 'To-Do' list. Whenever you feel like improving yourself, go back to your 'To-Do' list and complete your next module.

### Giving Back
- You are not alone in this community!
- Everyone is always looking to help you out, but also don't be afraid to pay it forward and also helping someone else out as well.
- Pulling up each other up will benefit everyone overall in the long run.
- After solving a specific box, it's encourage to document your steps, commands, tools, etc. and post it online to help others learn from you.

> Tip: It's best to publish a walkthrough for a recently retired box. So, try to prepare a writeup for a live box you have completed, and publish it once its retired.
