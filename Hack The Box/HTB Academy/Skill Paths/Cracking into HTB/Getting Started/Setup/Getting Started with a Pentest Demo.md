### Choosing a Distro
- Many Linux distros exist for penetration testing.
- No silver bullet distro exists that contains tools that we may need or ever use.
- Therefore, we should eventually strive towards creating a custom pen testing VM, but prebuilt distros are great for now as we get more accumulated to our toolbox.
- HTB takes advantage of [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) for its VM, which is one of many of these distros. Others you can setup and use yourself include Kali Linux, Pentoo, and Black Arch.
- Each penetration test or security assessment should use separate instances to ensure the mix-up of sensitive data.
- Either you can spin up separate VMs or take advantage of tools like exegol, which use the Docker image to easily spin up small VMs.

### Setting It Up
- While we can set up our environment multiple ways, it's just recommended to use virtualization software to create our VMs.
- Options include [bare metal hypervisors](https://www.vmware.com/topics/bare-metal-hypervisor) like [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/), [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html).
- Other options within that boat also include Window's [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/), or QEMU/KVM on Linux.
- We can use hypervisors like  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) that work on both Windows and Linux operating systems.  
- `Hypervisor`: software allowing for the creation and running virtual machines (VMs) by using our host system to share memory/processing resources with it to run other operating systems onto of your existing, bare metal operating system.  
- They offer a layer of isolation and protection between our production network and vulnerable networks, such as Hack The Box, or when connecting to client environments from a VM (though VM breakout vulnerabilities do arise from time to time).
- VMs should be something everyone in a technical infosec role should be comfortable working with.
- VMs are great in allowing us to create home labs, which can be used for practicing new tools/skills to improve our craft.
- Two formats exist for building a VM:
	- `Optical disc image (ISO)`
		- CD-ROM file that is able to mount within our hypervisor to build the VM by installing the operating system ourselves. 
		- Gives room for customization, like keyboard layout, locale, desktop environment switch, and custom partitioning.
	- `Open Virtual Appliance (OVA)`
		- Pre-built virtual appliance that contains an `OVF` XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a `VMDK`, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. 
		- Can rapidly be deployed and running


### PwnBox
- The Pwnbox can be used in any module section that have interactive elements.
- They can be stared by clicking the `Start Instance` button.
- It's recommended to use that as it's easy to use and spawn, but we are also given the option to download our VPN connection file if we want to create our own VMs a well.
- Remember: Docker instances can be accessed without requiring a separate VPN connection.
- Specific hosts that require different VPN access if not accessed from the Pwnbox will have a VPN key available to use.
