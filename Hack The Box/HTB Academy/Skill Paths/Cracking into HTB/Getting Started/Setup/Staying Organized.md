### Folder Structure
- We should always have a clear folder structure when documentation our progress.
	-This may include scoping information, enumeration data, evidence of exploitation attempts, sensitive data such as credentials, and other data obtained during recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation. 
- A sample folder structure may look like follows:

- Folders and subfolders are used to organize data based on what they are representing. This can be anything from text documents to images/screenshots.
- Some create a folder for each target host and save screenshots within it.
- Others create their notes by host or network and save screenshots directly into the note-taking tool. 
- Ultimately, it is up to you. Find something that works for you the best.


### Note Taking
- This is very important, as it allows for us to keep track of all of our information in a easily-accessible format.
- We can use any note taking app, some may have features that work better for us.
- A few examples include:

- Some tools like Notion and GitBook offer richer features for creating Wiki-type pages, cheat sheets, and more.
- Remember: client data should always be local to the machine when doing real-world assessments to ensure maximum privacy/security.

> Tip: Learning [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language is easy and very useful for note taking, as it can be easily represented in a visually appealing and organized way.


### Other Tools and Tips
- Every infosec professional has and should have a knowledge base. 
- This knowledge base is ultimately up to you on whatever works the base.
- This includes quick reference guides for setup tasks performed on most assessments, along with cheat sheets for common commands we may need for that specific phase.
- Any payload, command, or tip we learn should always be documented. It may be proven useful later on.
- HTB Academy Modules have cheat sheets of relevant commands from their sections, so that can be downloaded and used for future reference. 
- Checklists and report templates for various assessment types, and findings/vulnerability database are also useful to us as well.  
- Having this system in place saves us us time during the reporting phase.
- That way, we can use the bulk of it and just modify it based on the current target environment.
