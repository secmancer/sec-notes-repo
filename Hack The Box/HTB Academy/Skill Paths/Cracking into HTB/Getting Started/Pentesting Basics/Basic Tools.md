    ```bash
    ssh Bob@10.10.10.10
    ```
- **Features**:
    - Use SSH keys for authentication.
    - Map local ports to remote hosts for better enumeration.



### **2. Netcat (nc)**
- **Definition**: A network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports.
- **Primary Uses**:
    - Banner grabbing to identify services.
    - File transfers between systems.
    - Connecting to and interacting with shells.
- **Example Command**:
    ```bash

    - **Split Horizontally**: `[CTRL + B], SHIFT + "`.
    - **Switch Panes**: `[CTRL + B], [Arrow keys]`.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Efficient session management during pentests.
    - Session logging.
    - Reference: Tmux cheatsheet and tutorials (e.g., Ippsecâ€™s videos).



### **4. Vim**
- **Definition**: A text editor for Linux, efficient for file editing over remote sessions.
- **Usage**:
    - Open a file:
        ```bash
