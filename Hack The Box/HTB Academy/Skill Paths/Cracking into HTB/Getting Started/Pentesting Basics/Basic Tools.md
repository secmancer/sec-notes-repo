### SSH
- [Secure Shell (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)): network protocol, running on port `22` by default, that provides users a secure way to access a remote system. 
- SSH is able to be configured to use either password authentication or [public-key authentication](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/), by using a SSH public/private key pair. 
- The connection allows us to upload, download, and manipulate files from remote systems.
- A client-server model, is used, where the client connects to the SSH server by using a client application like `OpenSSH`. 
- Considering this, we may often intend to obtain credentials or an SSH private key to establish this connection.
- This is because often this SSH connection is way more stable than a reverse shell one, so it may allows the exploitation phase to go over more smoothly, along with finding and attacking other hosts in the network.
- Using credentials, we can login by using the username `@` the remote server IP:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10

Bob@remotehost's password: *********

Bob@remotehost#
```
- There are methods in grabbing local private keys to use them for a later SSH connection as that specific user.


### Netcat
- [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc), `ncat`, or `nc`, is a network utility program for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. 
- A majority of Linux distros have netcat installed by default.
- A Windows copy also exists, but alternatives exist like PowerCat, which is netcat for PowerShell.
- Primary, it's used for connecting to shells. 
- It can also be used to connect to any listening port to interact with that service.
- `SSH` handles connections over port 22 by default.
- We can easily connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```
- In return, we get confirmation `SSH` is running on it. 
- This is called `Banner Grabbing`, in which knowing what service runs on that port may be useful for our future endeavors.
- Netcat is also able to transfer files between machines.

### Socat
- Programs like socat intend to take netcat and expand apon it with new features, like port forwarding and serial device connections. 
- socat is also a very useful tool to have in our arsenal for providing a more stable reverse shell connection.

### Tmux
- `tmux` expands the standard Linux terminal's features by allowing us to have multiple windows within one terminal and allow us to jump between them. 
- We can easily install it onto our system, if not already there:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install tmux -y
```
- Enter `tmux` into the command line to fire it up.
- The default key to input `tmux` commands prefix is `[CTRL + B]`. In order to open a new window in `tmux`, we can hit the prefix 'i.e. `[CTRL + B]`' and then hit `C`.
- We see the numbered windows at the bottom. We can switch to each window by hitting the prefix and then inputting the window number, like `0` or `1`. We can also split a window vertically into panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + %]`.
- We can also split into horizontal panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + "]`.
- We can switch between panes by hitting the prefix and then the `left` or `right` arrows for horizontal switching or the `up` or `down` arrows for vertical switching. 
- The commands above cover some basic `tmux` usage. It is a powerful tool and can be used for many things, including logging, which is very important during any technical engagement. This [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com) is a very handy reference. 
- Also, this [Introduction to tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqehvpe_djs) video by `ippsec` is worth your time.


### Vim
- [Vim](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/vim1.html) is a great text editor that can be used for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems. 
- One of the great benefits of using `Vim` is that it relies entirely on the keyboard, so you do not have to use the mouse, which (once we get the hold of it) will significantly increase your productivity and efficiency in writing/editing code. 
- We usually find `Vim` or `Vi` installed on compromised Linux systems, so learning how to use it allows us to edit files even on remote systems. `Vim` also has many other features, like extensions and plugins, which can significantly extend its usage and make for a great code editor. Let's see some of the basics of `Vim`. 
- To open a file with `Vim`, we can add the file name after it:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ vim /etc/hosts
```
- If we want to create a new file, input the new file name, and `Vim` will open a new window with that file. 
- Once we open a file, we are in read-only `normal mode`, which allows us to navigate and read the file. To edit the file, we hit `i` to enter `insert mode`, shown by the "`-- INSERT --`" at the bottom of `Vim`. Afterward, we can move the text cursor and edit the file.
- Once we are finished editing a file, we can hit the escape key `esc` to get out of `insert mode`, back into `normal mode`. When we are in `normal mode`, we can use the following keys to perform some useful shortcuts:

> Tip: We can multiply any command to run multiple times by adding a number before it. For example, '4yw' would copy 4 words instead of one, and so on.

- If we want to save a file or quit `Vim`, we have to press`:` to go into `command mode`. Once we do, we will see any commands we type at the bottom of the vim window.
- There are many commands available to us. The following are some of them:

- `Vim` is a very powerful tool and has many other commands and features. This [cheatsheet](https://vimsheet.com) is an excellent resource for further unlocking the power of `Vim`.
