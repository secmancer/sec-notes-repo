### SSH
- [Secure Shell (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)): network protocol, running on port `22` by default, that provides users a secure way to access a remote system. 
- SSH is able to be configured to use either password authentication or [public-key authentication](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/), by using a SSH public/private key pair. 
- The connection allows us to upload, download, and manipulate files from remote systems.
- A client-server model, is used, where the client connects to the SSH server by using a client application like `OpenSSH`. 
- Considering this, we may often intend to obtain credentials or an SSH private key to establish this connection.
- This is because often this SSH connection is way more stable than a reverse shell one, so it may allows the exploitation phase to go over more smoothly, along with finding and attacking other hosts in the network.
- Using credentials, we can login by using the username `@` the remote server IP:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10

Bob@remotehost's password: *********

Bob@remotehost#
```
- There are methods in grabbing local private keys to use them for a later SSH connection as that specific user.


### Netcat
- [Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc), `ncat`, or `nc`, is a network utility program for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. 
- A majority of Linux distros have netcat installed by default.
- A Windows copy also exists, but alternatives exist like PowerCat, which is netcat for PowerShell.
- Primary, it's used for connecting to shells. 
- It can also be used to connect to any listening port to interact with that service.
- `SSH` handles connections over port 22 by default.
- We can easily connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```
- In return, we get confirmation `SSH` is running on it. 
- This is called `Banner Grabbing`, in which knowing what service runs on that port may be useful for our future endeavors.
- Netcat is also able to transfer files between machines.

### Socat
- Programs like socat intend to take netcat and expand upon it with new features, like port forwarding and serial device connections. 
- socat is also a very useful tool to have in our arsenal for providing a more stable reverse shell connection.

### Tmux
- `tmux` expands the standard Linux terminal's features by allowing us to have multiple windows within one terminal and allow us to jump between them. 
- We can easily install it onto our system, if not already there:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install tmux -y
```
- Enter `tmux` into the command line to fire it up.
- Default key for the command prefix is `[CTRL + B]`
- A full list of tmux commands can be found on this [cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com). 
- This [Introduction to tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqehvpe_djs) video can also be helpful too.

### Vim
- [Vim](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/vim1.html) is a text line editor situated within the command line. It is installed on most Linux systems, either Vim itself or its predecessor Vi.
- It's great for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems. 
- It works with only the keyboard, so no mouse needed. This means however, that a lot of practice is needed to master it.
- Vim also has a nice library of plugins and extensions we can use to.
- To open a file, we specify the file name:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ vim /etc/hosts
```
- To create a new file, input the new file name in a similar format above. Vim will institute the file creation and throw us into that new file for us to read. 
- Anytime we open a file, we are always on `normal mode`, which only allows us to just read the file. 
- Editing the file requires us to hit `i` to enter `insert mode`, which is shown by the "`-- INSERT --`" at the bottom. Once in this mode, then we can make changes to the file.
- Once done making changes, we can press `esc` to return to normal mode.
- Some useful commands while in normal mode are listed below:

> Tip: We can multiply any command to run multiple times by adding a number before it. For example, '4yw' would copy 4 words instead of one, and so on.

- Pressing `:` puts us into Vim's `command mode`, which can allow us to do actions like saving a file or quitting Vim.
- Many commands are available, but here's a short list of some:
