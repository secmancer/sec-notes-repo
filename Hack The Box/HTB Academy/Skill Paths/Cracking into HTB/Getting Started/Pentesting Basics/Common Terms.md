### **What is a Shell?**
- **Definition**: A program to interact with the operating system by taking user commands and executing them.
- **Types of Shells**:
    - **Reverse Shell**: Target initiates a connection back to the attacker.
    - **Bind Shell**: Opens a listening port on the target for attacker connection.
    - **Web Shell**: Executes commands via a browser, often non-interactive.
- **Popular Shell Programs**:
    - **Linux**: Bash, Zsh, Tcsh, Ksh, Fish.
    - **Windows**: cmd.exe, PowerShell.
- **Use Case**: Gaining shell access means exploiting a vulnerability or using credentials to interact with a system remotely.



### **What is a Port?**
- **Definition**: Virtual endpoints for network connections, associated with services or processes.
- **Categories**:
    - **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
    - **UDP**: Faster, connectionless (e.g., DNS, streaming).
- **Common Port Numbers**:
    - **20/21 (FTP)**: File Transfer Protocol.
    - **22 (SSH)**: Secure Shell.
    - **80 (HTTP)**: Web traffic.
    - **443 (HTTPS)**: Secure web traffic.
    - **3389 (RDP)**: Remote Desktop Protocol.
- **Importance**: Recognizing ports and their associated services aids efficient enumeration and attacks.
- **Tools**: Guides on TCP/UDP ports (e.g., nmapâ€™s top 1,000 scanned ports).



### **What is a Web Server?**
- **Definition**: Backend application managing HTTP traffic between browsers and web applications.
- **Common Ports**: TCP 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- **Importance**:
    - Web applications provide a large attack surface.
    - Vulnerabilities can lead to server compromise.
- **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**:
    1. **Broken Access Control**: Improper restrictions on user permissions.
    2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Exposure of sensitive data due to cryptographic issues.
    3. **Injection**: Unvalidated user inputs causing unintended commands (e.g., SQL injection).
    4. **Insecure Design**: Security weaknesses at the design level.
    5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Inadequate hardening or default configurations.
    6. **Vulnerable/Outdated Components**: Use of unsafe or unsupported libraries.
    7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Weaknesses in identity verification.
    8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Reliance on untrusted sources.
    9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Lack of breach detection and response capabilities.
    10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Exploiting applications to send unintended requests.
