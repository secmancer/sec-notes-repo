### Shells
- The shell is a program that takes input from the keyboard and then passes that input to the OS to run certain commands.
- Early on, the shell was the only interface available, but that has changed as GUIs have become more and more integrated.
- Different type of shells exist, like Window's command-line or PowerShell, and Linux's various shells.
- Specifically on Linux, the most common shell is Bash or Bourne Again Shell, which is a more enhanced version of the original Unix sh.
- However, other shells exist for Linux other than bash, like zsh, tsch, ksh, and fish.
- More commonly in InfoSec, when we say "getting a shell", what we mean is we are able to successfully exploit a system into giving us shell access so that we are able to run commands on it like if we were physically typing them onto that system.
- Shells can be obtained in multiple ways, like from exploiting vulnerable systems like a web application or a specific network/service.
- We can also get credentials for connection protocol like SSH and connect to the target that way.
- Different type of shells in InfoSec exist, here's a list of them:

- Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain a shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages (`Python`, `Perl`, `Go`, `Bash`, `Java`, `awk`, `PHP`, etc.). 
- Each type has a use case were it's most effective, with the cool part being that they are able to be written in any programming language!
- However, for the most part, it doesn't matter what language you use, but it's recommended to look what languages are installed during the reconnaissance stage to pick a more appropriate shell to use.
- These shells can be simple scripts, or much larger programs.


### Ports
- A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) are virtual points on a system allows us to access certain portions of it, usually for a specific service installed on there.
- Each service gets assigned a port, with no one port being shared with multiple services.
- Since services use ports, we often associate certain port numbers with certain services that default to that port.
- For example, `HTTP` messages often use port `80`, while `HTTPS` messages may often use port `443` instead. 
- Ports help computers understand, at a high level, how to handle all of the various types of data they may be receiving.
- Two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  
- `TCP` is more connection-oriented model.
	- Basically, the connection between client and server needs to be established first before anything else. 
	- Server needs to be in a listening state always.
- `UDP` is more of a connectionless communication model. 
	- No precautions like those TCP take exist, so no guarantee of data delivery and reliability exists.
	- Useful when error correction/checking not needed or handled by the application itself. 
	- Great for time-sensitive tasks, as dropping packets is faster than waiting for packets to get retransmitted. 
- There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` `UDP` ports available.
- Some well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:

- It's essentially we are able to grasp the idea of TCP/UDP ports and be able to recognize the services associated with some of them.
	- For example: 21 is TP, 80 is HTTP, 88 is Kerberos
- Practice and repetition allows us to get better at this.
	- However, we can also reference various guides like [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf).
	- This is also a great [reference](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/) as well.


### Web Server
- Web server: application that runs on the back-end, handling all `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routing it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds back to the client.
- Usually, they run on TCP ports 80 or 443.
- Since they are open on the Internet, a ton of them are at risk of getting compromised if a vulnerability exist within it.
- Because of that, they provide a vast attack surface, making them highly valuable.
- For a more specific reference, we can refer to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/, which is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
- This list has what is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities, but it not an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities.
- The OWASP Top 10 list is shown below:
