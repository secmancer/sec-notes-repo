- Code deobfuscation is essential for code analysis and reverse engineering, especially in red/blue team exercises.
- Obfuscated code, like malware, hides functionality, making it difficult to understand and complete security tasks.
- In this module, we will learn how to locate JavaScript code, understand obfuscation, deobfuscate it, decode messages, analyze code, and send HTTP requests.
- The goal is to replicate and uncover the functionality of obfuscated code.
