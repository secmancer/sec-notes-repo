### Taking a Closer Look
- Now that we have deobfuscate the code, let's go through it
```javascript
'use strict';
function generateSerial() {
  ...SNIP...
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
  var url = "/serial.php";
  xhr.open("POST", url, true);
  xhr.send(null);
};
```
- We see that the `secret.js` file contains only one function, `generateSerial`.


### HTTP Requests
- Let’s break down the `generateSerial` function line by line.
- **Variables**:
    - The function defines `xhr` as an instance of `XMLHttpRequest`, used for handling web requests.
    - The `URL` variable contains `/serial.php`, likely pointing to the same domain since no domain is specified.
- **Functions**:
    - `xhr.open("POST", URL)` opens an HTTP `POST` request to `/serial.php`.
    - `xhr.send()` sends the request.
    - The function sends a `POST` request to `/serial.php` without sending any data or receiving a response.
    - This might be intended for generating a serial, but since there’s no corresponding HTML element triggering it, it may not be in use yet.
- **Analysis**:
    - The deobfuscated code reveals this functionality.
    - If the server handles this request, it might uncover hidden features or vulnerabilities.
