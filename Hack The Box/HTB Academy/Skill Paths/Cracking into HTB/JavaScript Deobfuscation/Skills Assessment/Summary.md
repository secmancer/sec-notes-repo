### **Summary: JavaScript Deobfuscation**

#### **Key Learnings**

1. **Locating JavaScript Code**:
    
    - Examined the HTML source code of a webpage to find embedded or linked JavaScript files.
2. **Understanding Obfuscation**:
    
    - Explored methods used to obfuscate JavaScript, such as minification, packing, and encoding, which aim to make code less readable.
3. **Beautification and Deobfuscation**:
    
    - Beautified minified code using tools like browser DevTools or plugins (e.g., Prettier).
    - Deobfuscated scripts using specialized tools (e.g., UnPacker) or manual analysis.
4. **Code Analysis**:
    
    - Analyzed the deobfuscated code, identifying its variables, functions, and overall purpose.
    - Investigated key operations like HTTP requests (`XMLHttpRequest`) to understand the script's behavior.
5. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Learned to replicate the behavior of obfuscated JavaScript functions using tools like `cURL`.
    - Sent POST requests to specific endpoints, observing server responses.
6. **String Encoding and Decoding**:
    
    - Studied common encoding methods:
        - **Base64**: Encodes data in a compact, alphanumeric format.
        - **Hex**: Represents ASCII characters in hexadecimal.
        - **Rot13**: A simple Caesar cipher with a 13-character shift.
    - Used Linux utilities (`base64`, `xxd`, `tr`) to encode and decode strings.
    - Recognized encoded strings and learned to identify their type using patterns or tools like Cipher Identifier.

### **Practical Outcomes**

- Ability to:
    - Recognize obfuscated scripts and decode their output.
    - Beautify and deobfuscate JavaScript code for analysis.
    - Analyze JavaScript functions and replicate their behavior using HTTP requests.
    - Decode strings using Base64, Hex, Rot13, or similar encoding methods.

### **Next Steps**

- **Advanced Topics**:
    - Explore custom obfuscation methods.
    - Study encryption techniques and challenges in reverse engineering encrypted scripts.
- **Practice**:
    - Apply learned skills to real-world scenarios like CTF challenges or penetration testing.
- **Resources**:
    - Continue with modules like "Secure Coding 101" to deepen your understanding of obfuscation and secure coding practices.
