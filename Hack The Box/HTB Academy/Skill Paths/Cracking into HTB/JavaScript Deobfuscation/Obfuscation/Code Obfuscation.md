### What is obfuscation
- Obfuscation is used to make scripts harder to read while maintaining functionality, often slowing performance.
- Obfuscation tools rewrite code to make it more difficult to understand.
- Code obfuscators typically create dictionaries of code elements and refer to them during execution to rebuild the original code.
- Example: JavaScript code is often obfuscated due to its client-side execution.
- In contrast, server-side languages like Python and PHP remain hidden from end-users, reducing the need for obfuscation.


### Use Cases
- Developers obfuscate code to prevent unauthorized reuse or reverse engineering, protecting functionality and intellectual property.
- Obfuscation adds a security layer, particularly for authentication or encryption, but it’s generally not recommended for client-side use due to increased vulnerability.
- A common malicious use of obfuscation is to evade detection by Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems.
- In the next section, we’ll explore how to obfuscate and compare code before and after obfuscation.
