#### General Security Measures
- **Keep System Updated**: Regularly update the operating system and packages.
```
apt update && apt dist-upgrade
```
- **Configure Firewalls**: Use Linux firewall and/or `iptables` to manage traffic.

#### SSH Configuration
- **Disable Password Login**: Configure SSH to disallow password authentication.
- **Disable Root Login**: Prevent root user from logging in via SSH.
- **Use Least Privilege**: Limit user permissions using `sudo` configurations.
- **Install Fail2ban**: Protect against brute force attacks by banning IPs with excessive failed login attempts.

#### System Audits
- **Regular Audits**: Check for privilege escalation risks such as outdated kernels, permission issues, and misconfigured cron jobs.

#### Enhanced Security Modules
- **SELinux**: Implements security policies with granular access control by labeling processes and files.
- **AppArmor**: Provides application-specific security policies.

#### Additional Security Tools
- **Snort**: Network intrusion detection system.
- **chkrootkit**: Scans for rootkits.
- **rkhunter**: Scans for rootkits, backdoors, and exploits.
- **Lynis**: Security auditing tool for Unix-based systems.

#### Security Settings
- **Remove Unnecessary Services**: Disable and remove unused services and software.
- **Avoid Unencrypted Authentication**: Ensure services do not rely on unencrypted methods.
- **Enable NTP and Syslog**: Ensure time synchronization and logging.
- **Individual User Accounts**: Each user should have a separate account.
- **Enforce Strong Passwords**: Implement strong password policies.
- **Password Management**: Configure password aging and restrict previous passwords.
- **Account Lockout**: Lock accounts after failed login attempts.
- **Disable SUID/SGID Binaries**: Disable unwanted SUID/SGID binaries.

#### TCP Wrappers
- **Purpose**: Control access to services based on hostname or IP address.
- **Configuration Files**:
    - `/etc/hosts.allow`: Defines allowed services and hosts.
    - `/etc/hosts.deny`: Defines denied services and hosts.

**Example Configuration**:
- **/etc/hosts.allow**:
```
# Allow access to SSH from the local network
sshd : 10.129.14.0/24

# Allow access to FTP from a specific host
ftpd : 10.129.14.10

# Allow access to Telnet from any host in the inlanefreight.local domain
telnetd : .inlanefreight.local
```
- **/etc/hosts.deny**:
```
# Deny access to all services from any host in the inlanefreight.com domain
ALL : .inlanefreight.com

# Deny access to SSH from a specific host
sshd : 10.129.22.22

# Deny access to FTP from hosts with IP addresses in the range of 10.129.22.0 to 10.129.22.255
ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```
 - **Note**: The order of rules is significant. The first match is applied. TCP wrappers control access to services, not ports, and should be used in conjunction with a firewall.
