**Virtualization Overview:**
- Virtualization is the abstraction of physical computing resources (hardware, software, storage, network) to make them available virtually.
- Virtual components can be used just like physical ones.
- Key advantage: Creates an abstraction layer between physical resources and virtual images, enabling efficient resource utilization.
- Virtualization powers cloud services and must be distinguished from **simulation** and **emulation**.

**Types of Virtualization:**
- **Hardware Virtualization**:
    - Uses hypervisors to abstract physical hardware into virtual components.
    - Example: Virtual Machines (VMs) behave like physical computers.
- **Application Virtualization**: Abstraction of software applications.
- **Storage Virtualization**: Virtualization of storage resources.
- **Data Virtualization**: Abstracts data sources.
- **Network Virtualization**: Abstracts network functions.

**Virtual Machines (VMs):**
- A VM is a virtual operating system running on a host system (physical machine).
- Multiple VMs can run simultaneously on one host, each isolated from others.
- VMs rely on hypervisors to allocate hardware resources like CPU, RAM, and disk.
- VMs provide:
    1. Isolation between applications and services.
    2. Independence from the host OS and hardware.
    3. Easy migration or cloning to other systems.
    4. Dynamic hardware resource allocation.
    5. Improved hardware resource utilization.
    6. Faster system provisioning.
    7. Simplified management.
    8. Higher availability due to independence from physical resources.
- **Performance Impact**: The virtualization layer introduces some performance loss, but the benefits often outweigh this.

**VMware Overview:**
- VMware provides virtualization software such as **VMware Workstation Pro** and **VMware Workstation Player**.
- **Workstation Pro**: Supports multiple VMs running concurrently.
- **Workstation Player**: Limited to running one VM at a time.
- Installation files for **VMware Workstation Pro 17** can be downloaded for both Windows and Linux.

**VMware Installation on Windows:**
- Download the installer, run it, and follow on-screen instructions to install.
- After installation, restart the system to begin using VMware.

**VMware Installation on Linux:**
- Download the installation file.
- Use the following commands to install:
    - `sudo apt install build-essential -y`
    - `sudo bash ~/Downloads/VMware*.bundle`
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

**Introduction to VirtualBox:**
- **VirtualBox** is a free, open-source alternative to VMware.
- VirtualBox supports multiple disk formats (e.g., **VDI**, **VMDK**, **VHD**) and includes tools to convert between formats.
- **VBoxManager**: Command-line tool for managing VMs.
- **VM Encryption**: VirtualBox supports encrypting VMs for added security.

**VirtualBox Installation:**
- Install with:
    - `sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack -y`
