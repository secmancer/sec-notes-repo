A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is an isolated environment created on a physical server using virtualization technology. It is a part of **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** solutions, offering dedicated resources and complete management freedom.

#### Key Features:
- **Virtualization**: A VPS uses the resources of a physical server but provides functionality similar to a dedicated server.
- **Resource Allocation**: VPS ensures dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage) for each virtual server.
- **Management Freedom**: Users have full control over the operating system and applications they install.
- **Encapsulation**: Each VPS operates in isolation, independent of other virtual servers on the same physical machine.

#### VPS as a Cost-Effective Solution:
- **Compromise between Shared Hosting and Dedicated Servers**: A VPS provides a balance between the low cost of shared hosting and the complete control of dedicated servers.
- **Virtualization Efficiency**: Virtual replication of systems is more cost-effective than providing separate hardware for each user, keeping prices manageable while offering extensive functionality.
