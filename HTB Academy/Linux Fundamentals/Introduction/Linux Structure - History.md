The Linux operating system originated from various developments, starting with the Unix OS by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1970. Despite early obstacles like legal challenges to the BSD, the creation of the GNU project by Richard Stallman in 1983 paved the way for free, Unix-like software. However, it wasn't until Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, created the Linux kernel in 1991 that a widely adopted, free operating system emerged. Linux, now licensed under the GNU GPL v2, has grown significantly and supports over 600 distributions, including popular ones like Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. Known for its security, stability, and high performance, Linux is used across various platforms, from servers to smartphones. It is open-source, allowing modifications and widespread use, making it the most installed OS globally. Among its many distributions, Parrot OS, based on Debian, is particularly noted for its focus on security and privacy.
