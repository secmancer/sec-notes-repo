To effectively work with various Linux systems, gaining knowledge of the system's structure, processes, network configurations, users, directories, and settings is crucial. Below is a list of commands that provide essential information about the system, which is especially useful for both system administrators and penetration testers. Most of these commands are installed by default on Linux systems:

### Basic System Information Commands

1. **`whoami`** - Displays the current username.
    
    - **Example:** `whoami`
    - **Output:** `cry0l1t3`
2. **`id`** - Prints the user's identity, including the user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and group memberships.
    
    - **Example:** `id`
    - **Output:** `uid=1000(cry0l1t3) gid=1000(cry0l1t3) groups=1000(cry0l1t3),1337(hackthebox),27(sudo)`
3. **`hostname`** - Prints or sets the system's hostname.
    
    - **Example:** `hostname`
    - **Output:** `nixfund`
4. **`uname`** - Prints basic system information, such as kernel name, network node name, kernel release, and more.
    
    - **Example:** `uname -a`
    - **Output:** `Linux box 4.15.0-99-generic #100-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux`
5. **`pwd`** - Prints the current working directory.
    
    - **Example:** `pwd`
    - **Output:** `/home/cry0l1t3`

### Networking and Interface Commands

1. **`ifconfig`** - Configures network interfaces or views network interface parameters.
    
    - **Example:** `ifconfig`
    - **Output:** Displays network interfaces and their details.
2. **`ip`** - Manipulates and displays routing, devices, and tunnels.
    
    - **Example:** `ip addr show`
    - **Output:** Displays IP addresses of network interfaces.
3. **`netstat`** - Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and more.
    
    - **Example:** `netstat -tuln`
    - **Output:** Lists all listening ports.
4. **`ss`** - Investigates sockets, similar to `netstat` but more modern and with additional features.
    
    - **Example:** `ss -tuln`
    - **Output:** Lists open sockets and their statuses.

### Process and User Information Commands

1. **`ps`** - Displays current processes.
    
    - **Example:** `ps aux`
    - **Output:** Lists all running processes.
2. **`who`** - Displays who is logged in.
    
    - **Example:** `who`
    - **Output:** Lists users currently logged into the system.
3. **`env`** - Prints the environment variables or sets and executes a command.
    
    - **Example:** `env`
    - **Output:** Lists all environment variables.

### Hardware Information Commands

1. **`lsblk`** - Lists block devices.
    
    - **Example:** `lsblk`
    - **Output:** Displays block devices and their mount points.
2. **`lsusb`** - Lists USB devices.
    
    - **Example:** `lsusb`
    - **Output:** Lists all USB devices connected to the system.
3. **`lsof`** - Lists open files.
    
    - **Example:** `lsof`
    - **Output:** Lists files opened by processes.
4. **`lspci`** - Lists PCI devices.
    
    - **Example:** `lspci`
    - **Output:** Displays all PCI devices on the system.

### Exercises and Practical Usage

Familiarizing yourself with these commands can be extremely beneficial, especially in security assessments, system administration, or troubleshooting. For instance, knowing the current user (`whoami`), checking network configurations (`ifconfig`), or examining running processes (`ps`) can provide crucial insights into the system's state.

### Logging In via SSH

One of the most common ways to access a Linux system remotely is through SSH (Secure Shell). This command allows you to connect to a remote system and execute commands as if you were logged in locally.

- **Syntax:** `ssh [username]@[IP address]`
- **Example:** `ssh secmancer@192.168.1.100`

This command initiates an SSH session, allowing you to securely interact with a remote system.

By mastering these commands, you'll have a solid foundation for managing and understanding various Linux environments, whether you're administering servers, performing security assessments, or simply exploring different systems.
