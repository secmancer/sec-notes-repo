### Backup and Restore Tools on Ubuntu

**Rsync**

- **Overview**: Rsync is an open-source tool for securely backing up files and folders to a remote location or locally. It efficiently transfers only the changed parts of files, making it ideal for large data transfers.
- **Installation**: sudo apt install rsync -y
- **Backup Command**: rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory  user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
- **Options**:
	- `-a`: Archive mode to preserve attributes.
	- `-v`: Verbose output.
	- `-z`: Compression for faster transfers.
	- `--backup`: Create incremental backups.
	- `--backup-dir`: Directory for backup files.
	- `--delete`: Remove files from the remote host that are no longer present locally.
- **Restore Command**: rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/mydirectory
- **Secure Transfer**: rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
	- Uses SSH to encrypt data during transfer.

**Duplicity**

- **Overview**: A comprehensive backup tool that uses Rsync as a backend and offers encryption and remote storage options, including cloud storage like Amazon S3.

**Deja Dup**

- **Overview**: A user-friendly graphical backup tool that also uses Rsync for backups. It supports local and remote backups with encryption.

### Encryption Tools

- **GnuPG**: For encrypting backups.
- **eCryptfs**: Provides encrypted file system capabilities.
- **LUKS**: For encrypting entire block devices.
