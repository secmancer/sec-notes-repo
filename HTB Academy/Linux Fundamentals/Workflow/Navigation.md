- Use `pwd` to check your current location and `ls` to understand the contents of directories.
- Utilize `cd` for directory navigation and `TAB` for auto-completion to speed up the process.
- Regularly clear the terminal with `clear` or `[Ctrl] + [L]` to maintain a clean workspace.
- Leverage command history to quickly reuse or edit previous commands.

Experiment with these commands and techniques on your VM to become proficient in navigating and managing files in Linux.
