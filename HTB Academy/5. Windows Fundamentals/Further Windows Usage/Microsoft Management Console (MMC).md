The MMC is a tool used to group and manage administrative tools, or "snap-ins," to oversee hardware, software, and network components within a Windows environment. Introduced with Windows Server 2000, MMC is available on all Windows versions and allows the creation of custom administrative tools for distribution.

#### Key Features of MMC
- **Snap-ins**: These are administrative tools or modules that can be added to a console. They allow administrators to create a customized console with only the necessary tools for managing various services. Snap-ins can manage both local and remote systems.
- **Custom Consoles**: MMC enables the creation of custom consoles tailored to specific administrative needs, which can then be saved and distributed.
    

#### Opening MMC

    - Navigate to **File** â†’ **Add or Remove Snap-ins**.
    - Choose the snap-ins you want to include in your console.
