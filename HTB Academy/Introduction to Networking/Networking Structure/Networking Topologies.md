### Network Topology Overview

- **Network Topology**: Describes the arrangement and connection of devices (hosts, switches, routers) in a network.
- **Physical Topology**: The physical layout of devices and cabling.
- **Logical Topology**: How data flows through the network.

### Types of Network Topologies

1. **Point-to-Point**: Direct connection between two devices, simple and traditional.
    
2. **Bus**: All devices share a single communication medium. Each device can transmit data, but only one device can send data at a time.
    
3. **Star**: All devices connect to a central network component (e.g., router, hub, or switch). High traffic can occur at the central point, but it's easy to manage and troubleshoot.
    
4. **Ring**: Devices form a closed loop with each device connected to two others. Data travels in one direction, often using a token-passing protocol to control access.
    
5. **Mesh**:
    
    - **Fully Meshed**: Every device is connected to every other device, providing high reliability and redundancy.
    - **Partially Meshed**: Some devices are connected to multiple others, balancing redundancy and cost.
6. **Tree**: An extension of star topology where multiple star networks are connected. It's suitable for large networks, like in big buildings or campuses.
    
7. **Hybrid**: Combines two or more topologies. For example, a mix of star and bus topologies, creating a flexible and scalable network.
    
8. **Daisy Chain**: Devices are connected in a series, forming a chain. Common in automation systems where data passes through each device in the chain.
    

### Network Connections

- **Wired Connections**: Coaxial cables, twisted-pair cables, and fiber optics.
- **Wireless Connections**: Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite.

### Network Nodes

- **Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Switches**: Manage data traffic in various ways.
- **Routers/Modems, Gateways, Firewalls**: Control access and direct data across different networks.

### Key Points

- **Logical vs. Physical Topology**: Physical arrangement doesn't always reflect the logical flow of data.
- **Hybrid Topologies**: Used when combining different network structures to meet specific needs.
