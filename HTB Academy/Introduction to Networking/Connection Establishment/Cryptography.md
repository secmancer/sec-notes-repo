### Symmetric Encryption

- **Definition**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Key Management**: Secure distribution and storage of keys are critical. If the key is lost or compromised, the encryption is no longer secure.
- **Algorithms**:
    - **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: A 64-bit block cipher with a 56-bit effective key length. It’s now considered insecure due to its short key length and is largely replaced by AES.
    - **3DES (Triple DES)**: Enhances DES by applying encryption three times with different keys. It provides more security but is slower than AES.
    - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys. It’s faster and more secure than DES and is widely used in various applications and protocols.

### Asymmetric Encryption

- **Definition**: Uses a pair of keys—public and private. The public key encrypts data, and the private key decrypts it.
- **Advantages**:
    - **Key Distribution**: Public keys can be shared openly, eliminating the need for secure key exchange.
    - **Security**: Based on complex mathematical problems, making it difficult to crack without the private key.
- **Algorithms**:
    - **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**: One of the earliest and most commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithms.
    - **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**: Provides encryption for emails and files, using both asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
    - **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Provides the same level of security as RSA with shorter key lengths, improving efficiency.

### Cipher Modes

Cipher modes determine how a block cipher encrypts data. Common modes include:

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**:
    - **Description**: Encrypts each block of data independently. Susceptible to pattern analysis and generally not recommended for secure applications.
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**:
    - **Description**: Each block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption. It’s widely used and considered secure for many applications.
- **CFB (Cipher Feedback)**:
    - **Description**: Encrypts data in segments, making it suitable for real-time encryption of data streams.
- **OFB (Output Feedback)**:
    - **Description**: Encrypts data streams by generating a keystream from the cipher, reducing vulnerability to certain attacks.
- **CTR (Counter)**:
    - **Description**: Encrypts data by generating a keystream from a counter value. It’s efficient for real-time data encryption and decryption.
- **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)**:
    - **Description**: Provides both confidentiality and integrity, making it suitable for secure communications like VPNs and wireless protocols.

Each mode has specific applications based on its strengths and suitability for different data encryption scenarios. The choice of mode impacts both the security and performance of the encryption process.
