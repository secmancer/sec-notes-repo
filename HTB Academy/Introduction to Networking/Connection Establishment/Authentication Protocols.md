### **Authentication Protocols**

**1. Kerberos**

- **Description**: Key Distribution Center (KDC) based protocol using tickets to authenticate users in a domain environment.
- **Strengths**: Efficient for managing authentication within large networks.
- **Use Case**: Common in enterprise environments and network services.

**2. SRP (Secure Remote Password)**

- **Description**: Password-based authentication protocol using cryptography to prevent eavesdropping and MITM attacks.
- **Strengths**: Secure against eavesdropping; does not require prior shared secrets.
- **Use Case**: Secure authentication for various network applications.

**3. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**

- **Description**: Cryptographic protocol for secure communication over a network.
- **Strengths**: Provides encryption and authentication.
- **Use Case**: Historically used for securing web traffic; largely replaced by TLS.

**4. TLS (Transport Layer Security)**

- **Description**: Successor to SSL, offering secure communication over the internet.
- **Strengths**: Enhanced security compared to SSL; supports various cryptographic algorithms.
- **Use Case**: Used in HTTPS, email, and other secure communications.

**5. OAuth**

- **Description**: Open standard for authorization, allowing users to grant third-party access without sharing passwords.
- **Strengths**: Delegated access without exposing user credentials.
- **Use Case**: Common in web services and APIs for secure resource access.

**6. OpenID**

- **Description**: Decentralized authentication protocol enabling single identity use across multiple sites.
- **Strengths**: Simplifies login process with single sign-on.
- **Use Case**: Used for federated identity management across websites.

**7. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**

- **Description**: XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
- **Strengths**: Facilitates single sign-on (SSO) and secure information exchange.
- **Use Case**: Common in enterprise SSO solutions and federated identity systems.

**8. 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**

- **Description**: Authentication method using two different factors to verify identity.
- **Strengths**: Adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
- **Use Case**: Widely used for securing access to accounts and systems.

**9. FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)**

- **Description**: Consortium developing open standards for strong authentication.
- **Strengths**: Focuses on usability and security with biometric and hardware-based methods.
- **Use Case**: Enhances security for online and mobile authentication.

**10. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**

- **Description**: System for securely exchanging information using public/private key pairs.
- **Strengths**: Provides encryption and digital signatures.
- **Use Case**: Used for secure email, document signing, and encryption.

**11. SSO (Single Sign-On)**

- **Description**: Allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- **Strengths**: Reduces password fatigue and improves user experience.
- **Use Case**: Common in enterprise environments and web applications.

**12. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**

- **Description**: Uses multiple factors (something known, something possessed, something inherent) to authenticate.
- **Strengths**: Provides enhanced security by requiring multiple forms of verification.
- **Use Case**: Secures access to sensitive systems and data.

**13. PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)**

- **Description**: Simple protocol sending passwords in clear text.
- **Strengths**: Basic and easy to implement.
- **Limitations**: Insecure due to sending passwords in plain text.

**14. CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)**

- **Description**: Uses a three-way handshake for authentication, protecting passwords.
- **Strengths**: More secure than PAP; passwords are not sent in clear text.
- **Use Case**: Used in PPP connections.

**15. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**

- **Description**: Framework supporting various authentication methods.
- **Strengths**: Flexible; supports different authentication technologies.
- **Use Case**: Common in wireless networks and VPNs.

**16. SSH (Secure Shell)**

- **Description**: Network protocol for secure communication, including remote command execution and file transfers.
- **Strengths**: Provides encrypted communication and secure authentication.
- **Use Case**: Used for secure remote administration and file transfers.

**17. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**

- **Description**: Secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS for encryption and authentication.
- **Strengths**: Ensures secure web browsing by encrypting data.
- **Use Case**: Common for securing web traffic and online transactions.

**18. LEAP (Lightweight EAP)**

- **Description**: Wireless authentication protocol using EAP with RC4 encryption.
- **Strengths**: Provides mutual authentication for wireless networks.
- **Limitations**: Vulnerable to attacks; largely replaced by more secure protocols.

**19. PEAP (Protected EAP)**

- **Description**: Tunneling protocol using EAP and TLS for secure wireless and wired network authentication.
- **Strengths**: More secure than LEAP; uses TLS for encryption.
- **Use Case**: Used for secure authentication in enterprise wireless networks.

### **Comparison Summary**

- **Kerberos**, **OAuth**, **OpenID**, **SAML**, **SSO**, and **MFA** are commonly used for user authentication and access control.
- **SSL/TLS** and **HTTPS** provide encryption and authentication for secure communications over networks.
- **SSH** is used for secure remote access and file transfers.
- **LEAP** and **PEAP** are used for wireless authentication, with PEAP offering better security.
- **PKI** and **FIDO** focus on cryptographic techniques and strong authentication methods.
