### **Key Exchange Methods**

**1. Diffie-Hellman (DH)**

- **Description**: Allows two parties to agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel without prior shared information.
- **Strengths**: Fundamental for establishing secure communication channels; widely used in protocols like TLS.
- **Limitations**: Vulnerable to MITM attacks; computationally intensive, making it less practical for low-power devices.

**2. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)**

- **Description**: Uses large prime numbers to generate a shared secret key. It relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
- **Strengths**: Versatile for encryption, signing, authentication, and data protection.
- **Limitations**: Computationally intensive; less efficient compared to newer algorithms.

**3. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**

- **Description**: A variant of DH using elliptic curve cryptography, offering greater efficiency and security.
- **Strengths**: More secure and efficient compared to DH; used in protocols like TLS and IKE; supports forward secrecy.
- **Limitations**: Still requires careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities.

**4. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**

- **Description**: Uses elliptic curves to generate digital signatures for authentication.
- **Strengths**: Efficient and secure; provides robust authentication and integrity.
- **Limitations**: Depends on proper implementation; security is dependent on the curve used.

### **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**

**1. IKE Overview**

- **Description**: A protocol for establishing and maintaining secure communication sessions, commonly used in VPNs.
- **Strengths**: Combines Diffie-Hellman and other cryptographic techniques for secure key exchange; supports both RSA and AES for various security needs.
- **Modes**:
    - **Main Mode**: More secure, involves three phases of key exchange.
    - **Aggressive Mode**: Faster performance but less secure due to fewer round trips and lack of identity protection.

**2. Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)**

- **Description**: A secret value shared between parties to authenticate and establish a shared secret.
- **Strengths**: Adds an extra layer of security; useful for scenarios where pre-shared secrets are practical.
- **Limitations**: Secure exchange of the PSK is challenging; vulnerable to MITM attacks if not handled properly.
