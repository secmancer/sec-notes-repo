**Overview:**

- Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) is a dynamic process that adapts based on available tools, organizational permissions, and network visibility.
- The goal is to establish a repeatable process for performing traffic analysis to identify, examine, and mitigate potential network issues.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Traffic Analysis:** A detailed examination of network events or processes to determine their origin, impact, and to take preventive actions.
    
    - Focus on breaking down data into manageable pieces.
    - Look for deviations from regular traffic, such as unauthorized remote access (e.g., RDP, SSH, Telnet) or other anomalies.
    - Establishing a traffic baseline helps identify unusual patterns or potential threats.
- **Versatility:** Traffic analysis is an essential tool for network defense, providing visibility into network usage, top-talking hosts, and internal communications.
    
    - **Visibility:** Key benefit of NTA; allows setting baselines and detecting changes.
    - Advanced implementations include integrating NTA with tools like IDS/IPS, firewalls, and SIEM solutions (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack) for enhanced monitoring and alerting.

**Importance in Daily Operations:**

- NTA assists in troubleshooting network issues by analyzing live traffic to ensure infrastructure and protocols are functioning correctly.
- Manual traffic analysis, combined with automated tools, offers a balanced approach to network monitoring.
    - **Human Insight:** While tools can be beaten, human observation remains crucial for detecting malicious activities.

**Analysis Dependencies:**

- **Traffic Capturing:**
    
    - **Passive Capture:** Involves copying data without interacting with the packets. Requires tools like TCPDump, Wireshark, or Netminer, and the necessary permissions.
        - **Mirrored Port:** Needed to inspect traffic not directly visible to our segment.
        - **Baseline Knowledge:** Understanding typical traffic flows aids in filtering out normal activity to focus on anomalies.
    - **Active Capture:** Involves in-line traffic capturing, often requiring a network topology change and devices like Network Taps or hosts with multiple NICs.
        - **In-line Placement:** Required for duplicating and inspecting traffic from source to destination.
        - **Processing Power:** Both passive and active capturing demand substantial storage and processing power.
- **Scenario Example:**
    
    - Without a baseline, analyzing captured traffic can become overwhelming, as every conversation must be examined.
    - With a baseline, known-good communications can be filtered out, making it easier to spot irregularities like unexpected inter-host communications over uncommon ports (e.g., user PCs communicating over ports 8080 and 445).

**Conclusion:**

- Fast detection of network intrusions minimizes potential damage.
- Understanding traffic flows and protocol behavior is crucial for effective network defense.
