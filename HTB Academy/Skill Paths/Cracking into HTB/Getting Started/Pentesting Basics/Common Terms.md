### What is a Shell?
- `Shell` is a very common term that we will hear again and again during our journey. It has a few meanings. 
- On a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function. 
- In the early days of computing, the shell was the only interface available for interacting with systems. 
- Since then, many more operating system types and versions have emerged along with the graphic user interface (GUI) to complement command-line interfaces (shell), such as the Linux terminal, Windows command-line (cmd.exe), and Windows PowerShell.
- Most Linux systems use a program called [Bash (Bourne Again Shell)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of [sh](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html), the Unix systems' original shell program. 
- Aside from `bash` there are also other shells, including but not limited to [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), [Tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh), [Ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell), [Fish shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)), etc.
- We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system). 
- This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access (typically `bash` or `sh`) and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged in to the host. 
- A shell may be obtained by exploiting a web application or network/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and logging into the target host remotely. There are three main types of shell connections:

- Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain a shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages (`Python`, `Perl`, `Go`, `Bash`, `Java`, `awk`, `PHP`, etc.). 
- These can be small scripts or larger, more complex programs to facilitate a connection from the target host back to our attacking system and obtain "shell" access. Shell access will be discussed in-depth in a later section.

### What is a Port?
- A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. 
- Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. 
- Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).
- Each port is assigned a number, and many are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run on a non-standard port). 
- For example, `HTTP` messages (website traffic) typically go to port `80`, while `HTTPS` messages go to port `443` unless configured otherwise. 
- We will encounter web applications running on non-standard ports but typically find them on ports 80 and 443. Port numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices. 
- At a very high level, ports help computers understand how to handle the various types of data they receive.
- There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  
- `TCP` is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. 
- The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.  
- `UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. 
- `UDP` is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. `UDP` is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with `TCP` and can significantly affect a real-time system. 
- There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` different `UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:

- As information security professionals, we must be able to quickly recall large amounts of information on a wide variety of topics. It is essential for us, especially as pentesters, to have a firm grasp of many `TCP` and `UDP` ports and be able to recognize them from just their number quickly (i.e., know that port `21` is `FTP`, port `80` is `HTTP`, port `88` is `Kerberos`) without having to look it up. 
- This will come with practice and repetition and eventually become second nature as we attack more boxes, labs, and real-world networks and help us work more efficiently and better prioritize our enumeration efforts and attacks.
- Guides such as [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf) are great resources for learning standard and less common TCP and UDP ports. 
- Challenge yourself to memorize as many of these as possible and do some research about each of the protocols listed in the table above. This is a great [reference](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/) on the top 1,000 `TCP` and `UDP` ports from `nmap` along with the top 100 services scanned by `nmap`.

### What is a Web Server?
- A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. 
- Web servers usually run on TCP ports `80` or `443`, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses.
- As web applications tend to be open for public interaction and facing the internet, they may lead to the back-end server being compromised if they suffer from any vulnerabilities. 
- Web applications can provide a vast attack surface, making them a high-value target for attackers and pentesters.
- Many types of vulnerabilities can affect web applications. We will often hear about/see references to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). 
- This is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). 
- This list is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities and is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. 
- Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the OWASP top 10 as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for. The current OWASP Top 10 list is:
