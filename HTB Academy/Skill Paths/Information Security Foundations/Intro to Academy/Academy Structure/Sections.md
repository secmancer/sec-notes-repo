### What is a Section?
- A `section` is the smallest building block in the HTB Academy structure. 
- Each section covers a specific area in the larger module topic, and is `designed to be completed in one sitting`.
- For example, in this `Intro to Academy` module, this `Sections` section discusses sections!


### Types of Sections
- There are two types of sections: `Theory Sections` and `Interactive Sections`.
- `Theory sections` do not contain any practical elements. Instead, they build the foundational knowledge that is necessary to understand any upcoming practical/interactive lessons, and establish the basics for the entire module.
- On the other hand, `interactive sections`, which are denoted with a small , form the majority of sections within HTB Academy. This is where you will learn through practical examples and demos.
- You are always `highly encouraged to re-apply what you learned` throughout any interactive section, to ensure you get to practice what you learned.


### My Workstation
- To allow easier practice of what you learn in interactive sections, each module provides `your own workstation` (a.k.a PwnBox), which is a Linux operating system (Parrot OS), pre-packed with many tools to assist you in the learning process.
- Your workstation allows you to `re-do any examples` shown in Academy, as well as `solve any exercises or skills assessments`.
- You can spawn your workstation by clicking on the `Start Instance` button found at the end of any interactive section, and/or in the `My Workstation` box on the right of your screen, as shown below.


### Completing a Section
- You can click on the `Mark Complete and Next` button to complete any section. 
- However, if a section has any questions, then you must first `solve those questions` to be able to successfully complete the section.
- If you wish to skip a section, or delay solving the questions until later, you can click on the `Next` button or navigate to any other section in the module by clicking on it in the Table of Contents.


### Questions
- Start your workstation, then use the integrated terminal to find the Linux OS flavor by running the following command: cat /etc/issue
