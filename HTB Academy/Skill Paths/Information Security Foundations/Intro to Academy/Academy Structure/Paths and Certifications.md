### What is a Path
- `Paths` are a collection of modules that share a broader topic. 
- Certain paths lead to an `HTB Certification` after completing their corresponding `exam`. 
- A single module may show up in multiple paths if its topic matches the path's topic.


### Type of Paths
- There are two types of paths in HTB Academy: `Skill Paths` and `Job-Role Paths`. 
- You can enroll in any path by clicking on the `Enroll` button, which will make it easier to track your progress in the path and see the upcoming modules in it through the [Dashboard](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard) page.

> **Note:** Enrolling in a path does not unlock all of the modules within it. Hence, enrolling in a path does not cost any cubes.


- A `Skill Path` groups modules with a specific popular skill that students may want to learn. For example, students who are looking to learn the basics of different operating systems can enroll in the `Operating System Fundamentals` path.
- `Job-Role Paths`, on the other hand, are curated to prepare students for a specific job role in the cyber security market. Each Job-Role Path is linked to an HTB Certification, which requires passing a multi-day practical exam to obtain.

> **Tip:** You can estimate how long a path will take to complete by checking the duration mentioned underneath the path's title. This represents the sum of the `estimated time for completion` of each module in the path "in 8-hour work days".


### Obtaining a Certification
- An [HTB Certification](https://academy.hackthebox.com/exams) is the key achievement students should target within HTB Academy. As mentioned earlier, each certification is linked to a Job-Role path, which is specifically designed to prepare you for the certification exam.
- Any student, regardless of their level, can progress through HTB Academy and follow a path to advance their skills until they obtain a certification.
- By the time you obtain an HTB certification, you will have completed `hundreds of sections and exercises`, `tens of modules and skills assessments`, and have passed a `real-world multi-day practical exam`. So, you will be `market-ready` for the specified job role.

> **Note:** Completing a path also unlocks a new badge, and so does obtaining a certificate.
