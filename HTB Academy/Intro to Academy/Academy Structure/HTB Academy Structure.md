HTB-Academy:
- Breaks the material down into digestible chunks for the user to enjoy a seamless understanding of the content

The biggest learning block being offered is the **path**.
- A large learning block that consists of multiple **modules**.

Modules are the actual learning sessions, often containing one specific topic.

Some specific paths are linked to HTB certifications, which are obtained after completing that path and passing their exam.

Like a lot of things, completing all of these modules within the paths may be intimidating, especially with all of the heavy information being presented to the user. However, with breaking it into sections and modules, the information becomes more easily digestible.

We can then easily start with a section, build on through the modules, take the exams, and then finally come out with the certificates we are hoping for.

This allows you to be constantly testing our knowledge/skills all of the time while taking it one step at a time, allowing us to reaffirm the knowledge we have learned through repetitive modules. We can then turn this into gained skills.
