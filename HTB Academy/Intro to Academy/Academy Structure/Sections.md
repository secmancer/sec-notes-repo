### What is a Section?
- Section: covers specific area of the larger, overall topic
	- Designed to be completed in one setting

### Types of Sections

	- Theory sections build on foundational knowledge to understand upcoming practical/interactive sessions. They don't have these elements themselves.
	- Interactive sections, denoted with a cube, have you learn through practical examples/demos.

### My Workstation
- A workstation (PwnBox) is provided to complete interactive sections
- Uses Parrot OS, a Linux distro, to provide the necessary tools in helping you complete them and further yourself in the learning process.
- Allows you to re-do any examples given to you as well

- All questions must be solved for the section to be completed.
- Sections can be skipped over to have them be solved later on.


### Questions:
