### What is a Section?
**Section**: smallest building block in the academy structure
- Covers an area of the larger topic
- Designed to be completed in one setting
### Types of Sections

Two types are available: Theory Sections and Interactive Sections

Theory Sections: no practical elements, but instead build the foundational knowledge necessary to understand and do and upcoming practical/interactive lessons down the road
- Overall establishes the basics of the entire module

Interactive sessions: are denoted with the cube icon and make up the majority of the module. This is where knowledge is then applied through examples/demos.

Highly encourages to re-apply what we have learned to ensure better practice.
### My Workstation

Each modules provides a workstation (called PwnBox), installed with the Parrot OS Linux distro.
- Installed with all of the tools to assist you in the overall learning process.

This allows us to re-do any examples and solve exercises/skill assessments.

It can be started by starting the Start Instance button at the end of a interactive session and/or in the separate My Workstation box on the right side of the screen.
### Completing a Section

Clicking Mark Complete and Next is necessary to completing the session. Questions must be solve if the section provides them.

You are able to skip a section by clicking the Next button or clicking on another section. However, it must be completed at some point to ensure 100% module completion.
