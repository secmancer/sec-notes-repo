### Types of Targets

Like discussed earlier, we have access to Docker or VM targets depending on the exercise.

Docker Targets:
- Most exercises use this, as they are faster to spawn and access.
- You can easily copy and paste the IP and PORT by clicking on it.
- Can be accessed in multiple ways, like in a web browser for appropriate modules
- May take up to a minute for it to be ready to go

VM Targets:
- Used for exercises that require more advanced topics
- Examples may include a Windows target for ActiveDirectory or a network environment
- Similar spawning process, but may take a little longer to start
- IP can be access through your provided workstation or through your custom one by a VPN connection file
