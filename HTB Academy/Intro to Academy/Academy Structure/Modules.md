### What is a Module?
**Module**: core building block within the academy
- Represents a single course that covers a specific topic within a path.

Like we have discussed earlier, modules are built from multiple **sections**, and multiple modules build a **path**.

Clicking on the Modules page, it allows us to preview the summary.
- Covers what is the expected outcome and what requirements are needed to start the module (if applicable)

### Types of Modules

Modules are categorized into 3 areas: **Offensive**, **Defensive**, and **General**.

They are also rated based on how difficult they are: **Fundamental**, **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

In the Modules page, we are able to filter out based on category and rating to find the one that works the best for us.

### Module Tiers

Modules are split up into 5 tiers, with different cost to the module and reward for completing the entire module.

A module costs a specific amount of cubes to unlock permanently, and always gives the user back 20% of those cubes as a reward for completing it.

Tier 0 modules are the free modules, as they cost and reward the same amount of cubes back.

**Note**: you must complete the modules completely to get the cubes back

### Completing a Module

Completing a module involves solving all of the exercises and marking all sections that have been completed.

You then usually face a Skill Assessment towards the end of a module, representing a real-world scenario of which the topic of the module is covered along with all of the knowledge discussed before.

Once that is done, you are able to click the Finish button and complete the module. Doing so grants you the ability to write a review for it and also rewards you with a badge for the module along with the specified amount of cubes.
