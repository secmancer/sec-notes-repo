### Pick a Path
- Start with the Information Security Foundations for brush up on my existing knowledge
- Pick a job related path like Penetration Tester, SOC Analyst, or Bug Bounty Hunter
- Once you have more experience, look into something like Senior Web Penetration Tester.

New stuff is always getting added, so keep a lookout for that.
