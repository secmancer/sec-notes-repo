- **Get-Command**: Finds commands, aliases, or functions. Use `Get-Command -Verb <verb>` or `Get-Command -Noun <noun>` to filter commands.
- **History**: PowerShell maintains command history within the session using `Get-History`. The PSReadLine module stores history across sessions in a file located at `$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine`.
