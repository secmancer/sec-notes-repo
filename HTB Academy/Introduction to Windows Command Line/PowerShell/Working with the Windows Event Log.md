### What is the Windows Event Log?

The Windows Event Log is a system service that logs events related to hardware and software activities on a Windows system. It allows you to track and manage events generated by applications, system processes, and user actions.

### Event Types

1. **User-Generated Events**: Actions like mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and other user interactions.
2. **Application-Generated Events**: Include application updates, crashes, and performance metrics.
3. **System-Generated Events**: System-level activities such as driver loading, system updates, and user logins.

### Event Log Categories

- **System Log**: Logs system-level events like service failures.
- **Security Log**: Records security-related events such as login attempts.
- **Application Log**: Stores events related to applications installed on the system.
- **Setup Log**: Logs events related to system installation and domain controller activities.
- **Forwarded Events**: Logs events forwarded from other networked hosts.

### Event Types

1. **Error**: Major issues, e.g., service failures.
2. **Warning**: Potential issues that may need attention, e.g., low disk space.
3. **Information**: Successful operations, e.g., a network driver loads correctly.
4. **Success Audit**: Successful security access attempts.
5. **Failure Audit**: Failed security access attempts, e.g., incorrect password entry.

### Severity Levels

- **Verbose (5)**: Detailed progress messages.
- **Information (4)**: General system information.
- **Warning (3)**: Potential issues needing investigation.
- **Error (2)**: Serious issues that need immediate attention.
- **Critical (1)**: Major issues that could cause system instability.

### Key Elements of an Event Log

- **Log Name**: The category of the log.
- **Event Date/Time**: When the event occurred.
- **Task Category**: Type of event.
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier for the event.
- **Source**: Origin of the event.
- **Level**: Severity level of the event.
- **User**: Username associated with the event.
- **Computer**: Name of the computer where the event was logged.

### Working with Windows Event Log

**Using `wevtutil`**

- **List Logs**: `wevtutil el`
    - Lists all log names.
- **Get Log Info**: `wevtutil gl "LogName"`
    - Displays configuration information for a specific log.
- **Query Events**: `wevtutil qe LogName /c:5 /rd:true /f:text`
    - Retrieves the latest 5 events from a specific log.
- **Export Log**: `wevtutil epl LogName C:\path\to\export.evtx`
    - Exports a log for offline analysis.

**Using PowerShell (`Get-WinEvent`)**

- **List Logs**: `Get-WinEvent -ListLog *`
    - Shows all logs with their record counts.
- **Log Details**: `Get-WinEvent -ListLog LogName`
    - Lists details for a specific log.
- **Query Events**: `Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -MaxEvents 5`
    - Retrieves the last 5 events from the Security log.
- **Filter Events**: `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625}`
    - Filters and displays specific events based on ID.

### Practical Tips

- **Analyze Security Logs**: Look for failed logins (Event ID 4625) and successful logons (Event ID 4624) to detect potential unauthorized access.
- **Monitor System Stability**: Check for errors and warnings in system logs to preemptively address issues.
- **Use Event Logs for Forensics**: Event logs can be crucial for understanding attack patterns and post-compromise analysis.
