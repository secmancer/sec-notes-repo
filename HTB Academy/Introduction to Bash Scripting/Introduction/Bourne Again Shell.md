#### Overview:

- **Bash:** A scripting language used to interact with Unix-based operating systems, allowing users to execute commands and automate tasks.
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** Since May 2019, Windows users can utilize Bash in a Windows environment, making it crucial for penetration testers to master Bash for efficient cross-platform work.
- **Scripting vs. Programming Languages:**
    - **Scripting Languages:** No need to compile; executed directly by the interpreter (e.g., Bash).
    - **Programming Languages:** Typically require code compilation before execution.

#### Importance in Penetration Testing:

- **Cross-Platform Proficiency:** Penetration testers must be skilled in both Windows and Unix-based systems, especially for tasks like privilege escalation.
- **Terminal Mastery:** Essential for filtering data and automating processes, especially in large Unix-based networks.
- **Efficiency:** Knowledge of scripting increases speed and efficiency, particularly in handling and processing large amounts of data.

#### Structure of a Scripting Language:

- **Key Components:**
    
    - Input & Output
    - Arguments, Variables & Arrays
    - Conditional Execution
    - Arithmetic
    - Loops
    - Comparison Operators
    - Functions
- **Automation:** Scripting automates repetitive tasks and processes large datasets. A script is executed by an interpreter (e.g., Bash) rather than creating a separate process.
    

#### Script Execution Examples:

- **Executing a Script in Bash:**
    - `bash script.sh <optional arguments>`
    - `sh script.sh <optional arguments>`
    - `./script.sh <optional arguments>`

#### Example Script: `CIDR.sh`

- **Purpose:** Identify the network range of a target domain and check the status of discovered IP addresses.

#### Script Breakdown:

1. **Check for Given Arguments:**
    
    - Uses an `if-else` statement to ensure a domain is specified as a target.
2. **Identify Network Range:**
    
    - **Function:** `network_range`
    - Queries `whois` for each discovered IP to identify and display the network range, storing results in `CIDR.txt`.
3. **Ping Discovered IP Addresses:**
    
    - **Function:** `ping_host`
    - Pings each IP address in the network range to check reachability and counts the number of hosts that are up.
4. **Identify IP Address of the Domain:**
    
    - Uses the `host` command to retrieve the IPv4 address of the specified domain.
5. **Available Options:**
    
    - Provides options to run different functions:
        - Identify network range.
        - Ping discovered hosts.
        - Perform all checks.

#### Script Functions Recap:

- **Commented Sections:**
    1. Check for given arguments.
    2. Identify network range for the specified IP address(es).
    3. Ping discovered IP address(es).
    4. Identify IP address(es) of the specified domain.
    5. Available options for further actions.
