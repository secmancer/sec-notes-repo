Now, back to the original math problem:


```
20 * ________+ ________ = 65535
```


- Remember, we are learned to perform the calculation one way, in which we use the patterns we are used to figure this out.
- However, we need to use our new art form we have just learned: thinking outside the box, which is essential for the "hacker mindset"
- We're going to have to pivot here and think of possible, like easier methods to solve the above problem.

> `A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.`

- The learning process is not so clear theoretical/practical.
- It highly depends on our emotional state: we are to be more successful with a clear and calm mind than the opposite.
- We also need to know our goal to overcoming this challenge:

Take this scenario:
