We need to get ourselves familiar with our brain and know some of its components to understanding the role of it in upcoming sections, how they are structured, and how they can influence our learning process.

It's fascinating in making us who we are
- Most unexplored area we know, with many myths being applied to it instead
- One is we only use 5-10% of our brainpower, but this is false as the brain is always active in all regions, which has been tested through different studies like EEG and fMRI
- Another is you are more intelligent the faster you learn something.
- However, most don't know the brain regions responsible for the most difficult tasks don't even develop until we're around 20 years old.
- Then is our brain developed to the point where we can solve such tasks.
- Each person also takes a different amount of time to develop their brain regions as well.

Einstein was one, who was terrible at math and learned slowly throughout school.
- We also know people who were bad at school in one subject, but extremely talented in another.
- Without going too deep into cognitive science, neurology, psycho linguistics, and psychology, this indicates the development of specific brain regions of the human body.

Example: image of a computer nerd who is good at computers, knowing their insides and out, but really terrible social skills
- Can be traced back to development of specific brain regions as the brain changes on physiological level when we learn something new.

We have discovered methods that have effects on our brain in many ways.
- Until now, cognitive science hasn't been able to prove what a thought is.
- It is an interdisciplinary science that studies conscious and potentially conscious processes in which both conscious and subconscious minds are being explored.
- We have many different abilities, such as memory, language, perception, problem-solving, mental will, and much more.
- This will get discussed some point in recognizing their importance and impact. Only thing scientists have agreed on so far is that thought is not material, at least it has not been proven yet.


### The Theory of Thought
- Following definition is a personal view and how the author sees it
- Probably can be disagreed upon within different aspects.

> A thought is an individual process (action/reaction) to one or more influences (internal/external) in which information is interpreted and linked inwardly according to our personal methodology (developed through our existing lifetimes).

- To better understand, let us consider the following example:
	- Scotland has 421 words for "snow."
- When new information is read, a processes is started, which in this case, it a reaction to an influence we inwardly image and process.
- Working on this further, we can find at some point a series of nodes linked to different information.
- These are known as associations
- We know that our memory and information processing in different situations work based on these chains stored in our neuronal networks.
- We now know our brain is constantly working and producing thoughts
- We however cannot say precisely whether the brain is more active during our awake or sleep phase.
- This is since each of us has a subconscious and a conscious in which our thoughts are processes
- The Libet Experiment proved that and the conscious decision, respectively, the conscious experience gets delayed after our neuronal processes.

### Conscious Thoughts
- Very complex topic with many views/definitions
- Not researched enough to say how it works in detail
- We don't need to know for our purposes in this field to benefit from
- However, we should have an understanding in what we are talking about when talking about conscious and subconscious.
- For us, however, the definition below is sufficient for the description of human consciousness.

> Consciousness describes the totality of all those mental processes by which we become aware of the external and our internal world with active observation. Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looking at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and intentionally look elsewhere, we are in consciousness.


### Unconscious Thoughts
- Psychology tells of another level of consciousness, the subconsciousness.
- Thoughts that arise there do not perceive superficially
- What we perceive are emotions, as they reflect the way we think subconsciously.
- Those thoughts influence what we do, as studies show it already makes a decision 30 seconds before we become aware of it.
- Part of Libet's experiments shows the difference between conscious and unconscious experiments could depend on the duration of brain activity.
- In the experiments, subjects are given stimuli to the ascending sensory pathway in the thalamus.
	- The subjects saw two lamps, in which was illuminated alternately for one second.
	- They were asked to say which of the lamps was lit when the stimulus was administered.
	- If it lasted for less than half a second, they didn't consciously perceive the stimulus.
	- However, if they didn't consciously perceive a stimulus, the subjects were not consciously aware of the stimulus, they guessed correctly much more frequently than at random. When it lasts 150 to 260 milliseconds, the subjects guessed correctly 75% of the time.
	- For test subjects to perceive it consciously, the stimulus had to last 500 milliseconds.
