- Will can be interpreted different in many disciplines.
- In psychology, it's considered a descriptive construct that presupposes a conscious decision to act, and thus, it is primarily associated with rational action.
- Can be used in different contexts and several meanings
	- Like: mental act from which impulses to achieve specific goals emanates and the settings of goals, and the ultimate translation of these personally or collectively made decisions into action, that is, into conscious an deliberate or even planned action.
-  From a philosophical POW, will is defined as deciding on a particular type of action based on the motives for acting consciously.
- Will is the effort to perform an action or achieve a specific goal.
- Therefore, it is most relevant to have decided to achieve a goal that we have determined and strive for it.
- Before deciding to achieve a specific goal, we must be clear about our desires.
- In as much detail as possible, we should explain to ourselves what we want and how it must feel to achieve our goal. 
- This process can also be thought of as dreaming, or imagining a situation we would like to be in
- Most stop dreaming shortly after they start because they don't see a way to get there.
- This is since the essential part of the path plays absolutely no rule in how we reach that goal is overlooked.
- We can see a lot of famous actors, developers, and scientists often have not planned or foreseen their careers in the way they ultimately came about.


Desire is very dependent on that.
- When we believe in our abilities, it relieves us of our complexes and we get access to chains of associations of our thinking, interrupted by the pressure of our own fears.
- Let us remember the following sentence:

> Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.

- It's essential and healthy in life/health threatening situations
- However, sitting in a chair in front of a computer afraid of the tasks we have is irrational
- We have not worked yet through most of the material, but we are already beginning to program ourselves to fail

Let's ask if this fear is real:

> Have we already worked through all the material?
   Have we already seen what is being taught and how it is being taught?
   Do we already have to have the skills that are expected of us?

- If no is an answer to these questions, it's clear that we are afraid of something without even trying it.
- It's interesting, especially in our field, that many students react paradoxically.
- Most who feel a particular fear during learning are unaware of what they are afraid of.
- They believe in they are afraid of failing and not learning something well, but sometimes as soon as they get stuck on something, they give up often or not.
- Is not that the failure they were afraid of all along and want to avoid? Yes actually.
- These types of students find it easier to give up and fail than to keep learning and improving
- Getting better inevitably happens when we keep practicing and trying different approaches.
- We must keep a clear goal in mind to prevent this from happening so quickly.
