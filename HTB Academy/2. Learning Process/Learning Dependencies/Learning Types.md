- Learning can often be split up into two categories: Passive, Active

### Passive Learning
- With reading, we will learn only 10% of the whole knowledge.
- By watching some demonstrations, we will not learn anything more than 30%.

### Active Learning
- When discussing with others in what we learned, we then start retaining up to 50% of our experience.
- We can also practice on our own, in which our learning experience can grow up to 75%.
- Example: reading all about car and traffic rules will not prepare us in how to drive a car
- Information has certain levels of quality that we collect from, but it's important to remember that not all of it is helpful.
- It can instead have the opposite effect in confusing and disorienting us.
- Therefore, we need a repertoire, which we collect by practicing to understand the context of the topic we are researching.
- Efficiency depends on the quality and usage of that information.
- It also depends on our motivation, focus, and our goal.
- Many different ways exist to stay motivated.
- One is by recognizing success, even with the most minor successes. 
- We must recognize our successes to see what we have made regarding progress. We already know how important a goal is, so if we know it, then we know the direction of our actions.
- If we are focused, we'll notice when we drift out from our path. Following it will allow us to see how far we have come and look forward in making more progress.
- At this point, looking at how much progress we have made is vital.


Example: forcing ourselves to learn Web Application Penetration Testing in just two hours will not work. 
- There is just too much information and details to handle and processes to master in such a short time-span.

Let's look at another example:

>How do we empty a bottle of water? We turn the bottle around and let it flow, right?
  Why didn't we try to create a vortex by turning the bottle around the Y-Axis?  
  By creating a vortex, we let oxygen flow into the bottle regularly, and the water can flow out without closing the bottle opening.

Same idea happens in learning. Learning too much without breaks will get us stuck quicker.

> "So, how many breaks do we need and how long should they be?"

This is a question we must answer on our own as only ourselves will know what effects and consequences our own actions will have on us.

However, what happens when we get stuck?
- Many ways we can get here.
- Could be we focused too much and lost the content of the task at hand
- We get tired and did not take enough breaks

Solving a problem like this requires creativity. In penetration testing, it's essential to pay attention to details that may appear unimportant at first. 

Looking back, we can see terms print as **bold** and <span style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0)">green</span>.
- Taking a closer look, we can see these have essential meaning behind them
- It's crucial to train the eyes to notice even the most minor details
- All of our knowledge and experiences are based on associates that connect us with different perceptions, like colors and smells, for example.
- These are known to us as memories, as we are able to recall these later actively or passively.

This process only takes place in the course of practice. The next steps will see how important it is through a small practical example.
