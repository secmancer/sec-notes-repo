Obstacles slow us down or can even completely prevent us from reaching our goals, solving specific tasks, or acquiring and mastering skills.
### Fear

- A lot of afraid of something new, not known, and cannot be evaluate if it could harm them somehow.
- We have fears that are much more relevant to us: fear of the learning process and imaginary fear
- This is the fear in what we imagine ourselves for the future, more so than dangerous fear. This is the type of calculating out the consequences of that we calculate.
- Gotta remember this:

> People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.

- Imaginary fear: emotional state that holds us back from the best experiences and prevents us from moving forward on the desired path.
- Even if we want to be the best penetration tests, most are afraid to put all of what they have in it just because of this fear, due to multiple factors.

> "Which of the mentioned reasons are actually real right now?"

- Another factor is our previous failures.
- We need to remember though to write it down and always remember the following below:

> The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser.

Failure = essential to learning. It's always going to be unavoidable.
- No one has ever gotten a skill without making any mistakes.
- Failures are crucial here, in allowing us to gain momentum in continuing to climb higher and higher.
- After all, if we have a rope given to us, it doesn't help in doing us any good if we don't move
### Mindset

We can also create excuses in these sorts of scenarios.
These can include:
- I cannot do this
- This is not for me
- I do not understand this
- etc.

This is all from our mindset, which a negative one can make these sorts of excuses much easier for us to create.

Example: child constantly criticized for their successes and failures will find it challenging to dare try something new
However, the lack of criticism makes the child overconfident, which can lead to misjudgment of their abilities.

Mindset can also be seen as a different, but not just culturally conditioned beliefs.
- Example: belief that eye contact is a sign of interest and openness everywhere
- In Japan, this is considered an invasion of privacy and is considered rude

We need to be aware of such thought processes. Once we get this understanding of our way of thinking, we'll have more info to work with and better ourselves.

We can do techniques in making a more positive mindset. For example, we can add "yet" to the following statements as we aim to achieve more:
- I cannot do this yet.
- This is not for me yet.
- I do not understand this yet
- etc.
This has the effect of stimulating our beliefs and help in creating a more positive mindset.

All obstacles and feelings are just temporary. These will pass, but our goal remains.

Another factor is comparing skills, talent, and passion.
- We already learned what constitutes talent.
	- Talent is a strongly developed skill with high efficiency.
	- Skill is the ability to manage or solve something well.
	- Passion is an emotional commitment to a particular area.

Looking at these definitions, we will see that they are interrelated and mutually supportive and not, as many believe, holding them back.
- We have different talents with us.
- Thought patterns that make some tasks easier to understand and others a little more complicated, skills we learn, and the passion and dedication to achieve the desired goal.
### Pressure
Pressure can affect us in a lot of different ways.
- Psychological pressures can affect people based on a situation

Term stress describes a characteristic of conditions and not characteristics of people.
- In contrast to pressure, stress describes the non-specific reaction to any sort of pressure
- The occurrence of it requires a sensory perception of the stimulus and a transmission of such stimulus to that processing region of the body.

Internal influences
- Includes beliefs of our mindsets but also our attitudes
- Such thingsc are always a two-sided sword that brings advantages and disadvantages
-
