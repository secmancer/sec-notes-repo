Why is it important to ask questions?
- Asking the right questions is an essential skill for both technical and non-technical contexts.
- Many people struggle with distinguishing between right and wrong questions, or even understanding the purpose of a question.

What are the purpose of asking questions?
- The current view sees questions as tools for gathering information to guide decisions and actions.
- Questions provide **orientation**, helping us understand a situation and determine the next steps.

What are the metaphorical uses of questions?
- Questions help us visualize where we want to be or the direction we should take next.

Asking Questions in Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing:
- The search for the right **question** is often more important and more challenging than the search for the right answer.
- Once the right question is asked, finding the answer becomes easier.

Knowing The Challenge of Asking the Right Questions:
- It is particularly difficult to ask the right questions when we lack knowledge or understanding of a concept or situation.
- Many people face situations where they don't know how to approach a problem, often due to not knowing what question to ask first.

### Question States
There is no such thing as good or bad questions
- These terms are subjective and irrelevant to the outcome.

Examples:
- A question like _"What are good questions?"_ may have an answer like X, Y, and Z. Labeling the question as "good" or "bad" does not change the answer.
- The terms "good" or "bad" describe the questioner's perceived benefit from the answer, not the quality of the question itself.

Furthermore, let's take the analogy of jumping into water:
- Whether the water is cold, hot, dark, or transparent, the result (getting wet) remains the same.
- Basically, a question is always the same and has no impact on the answer, regardless of what term we try to assign

So why are these terms placed onto questions to begin with?
- People label questions based on the value they derive from the answer. If a question provides a beneficial answer, it's seen as "good"; if not, it's seen as "bad."
- However, the _state_ of the question does not impact the answer. The classification belongs to the **result**, not the question.

Instead of the good/bad terms, we can put questions into their own categories.
- Take the example:
	- **Rough question:** Vague, broad, e.g., _"How can I hack X?"_
	- **Precise question:** Focused, specific, e.g., _"How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"_

This level of precision in a question can influence the quality and specificity of the answer.
- This yields more actionable and relevant results, but precision doesn't make a question "good." Precision is a more useful categorization.****

### Questions in General
On average, we ask between 3-5 questions per minute, though this varies by situation.

Questions are essential to linking information in the brain and a crucial part of learning.
- Learning material is like ingredients.
- Questions are like the preparation method.
- Just as a recipe guides cooking steps, questions guide our learning process.

More precise questions lead to better understanding and results. For example:
- Rough question: _"How can I hack X?"_
- Precise question: _"How can I use the server's SMB service to identify user accounts?"

People often struggle to ask the right questions, but asking the right ones can lead to valuable insights and effective decision-making.

Questions help achieve specific goals:
- **Past:** Understanding the reason for an event.
- **Present:** Learning how something works.
- **Future:** Predicting outcomes.

**Three Core Aspects of Every Question:**
- **Origin:** Where the question comes from.
- **Process:** How the question is framed.
- **Result/Goal:** The purpose or desired outcome.

Question: "A sentence worded or expressed to elicit information."
- **Issue:** This definition focuses on form and overlooks cases where questions do not directly result in acquiring information.

Single-word questions like "Why?", "How?", and "Where?" are valid questions, yet challenge the completeness of the official definition.

The traditional definition fails in some contexts, such as when questions do not yield immediate answers. This suggests the need for a broader understanding of what questions are and their purpose.

Setting the right goal is essential for asking meaningful questions. For example, if the goal is only to obtain information, that goal might sometimes be missed.

Next step:
- How should we redefine a question if the official definition does not fully apply, and how can we better set goals for our questions?

### Relationship-Oriented-Questioning Model

What is the importance of questions in thinking?
- We ask questions frequently, about 3-5 per minute.
- Questions play a key role in connecting information in our brains, influencing how we learn and make decisions.
- Without questions, learning and comprehension are significantly diminished.

Questions guide us through complex problems or tasks, similar to how ingredients and preparation methods are outlined in recipes.
- They help us determine the next steps in the learning process, driving us toward our goals.

**Relationship-Oriented-Questioning (ROQ) Model**
- The model consists of 5 components:
    1. **Your Position**: Where you are in relation to the question.
    2. **The Object**: The core element or subject of the question.
    3. **Known**: What information is already understood.
    4. **Unknown**: What information is missing or unclear.
    5. **Other Position(s)**: The perspective of others (optional).
- At least two components must be defined when asking a question, and "Your Position" is always one of them.

**Steps for Using the ROQ Model**
- **Define the Object**: Identify the core subject of the question.
- **Map Relationships**: Explore the relationships between the components (Position, Object, Known, Unknown).
    - **Solid Line**: Describes a connection (e.g., How is X connected to Y?).
    - **Dashed Line**: Describes an effect (e.g., How does Y influence X?).

**Example Question Breakdown**
- Question: _What are all the methods available to remotely access Windows operating systems?_
    - **Your Position**: The position from which the question is being asked.
    - **Object**: Windows OS.
    - **Known**: Remote access methods (e.g., WinRM, Remote Desktop).
    - **Unknown**: Methods of remote access not known.
    - **Other Position(s)**: Perspectives of others (optional).

**Mapping Relationships for the Example Question**
- **Your Position and Windows**:
    - _Operating on_: We use Windows to complete tasks.
    - _Provides Functionality_: Windows is a widely used OS with compatibility and features.
- **Windows and Known Methods**:
    - _Listening Service_: Remote access methods like WinRM allow management over the network.
    - _Remote Access_: The methods provide remote control of Windows.
- **Known Methods and Your Position**:
    - _Using_: We use these methods to manage Windows remotely.
    - _Allow to Interact With_: These methods enable interaction with Windows.
- **Windows and Unknown Methods**:
    - _???_: Unknown methods require unknown services to be running.

**Model Flexibility**
- The ROQ model is stackable, meaning once unknown information is discovered, it can be redefined as known and incorporated into the model for further questioning.

### Practice

**Initial Difficulty**:
- The model may seem unusual at first, and many people face challenges when trying to apply it initially.
- The model becomes easier to use after practicing 5 to 10 times.

**Subconscious Use**:
- With practice, the ROQ model becomes second nature.
- You will start using it automatically, even during casual conversations.

**Practice Recommendation**:
- After practicing a few times, you'll internalize the model and see its effectiveness quickly.
- This model is like a recipe—after being shown the steps, it's up to you to "prepare the dish" through practice.

**Application Exercise**:
- Go back to the 3 to 5 questions noted earlier and apply the ROQ model to break them down.
- The results and conclusions will be enlightening and demonstrate the model’s utility.

**Special Feature of the ROQ Model**:
- If applying the model does not yield a clear answer, rephrase the question to make it more precise.
- This feature ensures that the ROQ model only works with well-defined questions that can lead to clear answers.

**Defining the Right Question**:
- A "right" question is precise and allows you to:
	- Establish relationships between components.
	- Understand the relationships.
	- Move closer to the desired answer.
