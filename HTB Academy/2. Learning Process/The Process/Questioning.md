Why is it important to ask questions?
- Asking the right questions is an essential skill for both technical and non-technical contexts.
- Many people struggle with distinguishing between right and wrong questions, or even understanding the purpose of a question.

What are the purpose of asking questions?
- The current view sees questions as tools for gathering information to guide decisions and actions.
- Questions provide **orientation**, helping us understand a situation and determine the next steps.

What are the metaphorical uses of questions?
- Questions help us visualize where we want to be or the direction we should take next.

Asking Questions in Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing:
- The search for the right **question** is often more important and more challenging than the search for the right answer.
- Once the right question is asked, finding the answer becomes easier.

Knowing The Challenge of Asking the Right Questions:
- It is particularly difficult to ask the right questions when we lack knowledge or understanding of a concept or situation.
- Many people face situations where they don't know how to approach a problem, often due to not knowing what question to ask first.

### Question States
There is no such thing as good or bad questions
- These terms are subjective and irrelevant to the outcome.

Examples:
- A question like _"What are good questions?"_ may have an answer like X, Y, and Z. Labeling the question as "good" or "bad" does not change the answer.
- The terms "good" or "bad" describe the questioner's perceived benefit from the answer, not the quality of the question itself.

Furthermore, let's take the analogy of jumping into water:
- Whether the water is cold, hot, dark, or transparent, the result (getting wet) remains the same.
- Basically, a question is always the same and has no impact on the answer, regardless of what term we try to assign

So why are these terms placed onto questions to begin with?
- People label questions based on the value they derive from the answer. If a question provides a beneficial answer, it's seen as "good"; if not, it's seen as "bad."
- However, the _state_ of the question does not impact the answer. The classification belongs to the **result**, not the question.

Instead of the good/bad terms, we can put questions into their own categories.
- Take the example:
	- **Rough question:** Vague, broad, e.g., _"How can I hack X?"_
	- **Precise question:** Focused, specific, e.g., _"How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"_

This level of precision in a question can influence the quality and specificity of the answer.
- This yields more actionable and relevant results, but precision doesn't make a question "good." Precision is a more useful categorization.****

### Questions in General
On average, we ask between 3-5 questions per minute, though this varies by situation.

Questions are essential to linking information in the brain and a crucial part of learning.
- Learning material is like ingredients.
- Questions are like the preparation method.
- Just as a recipe guides cooking steps, questions guide our learning process.

More precise questions lead to better understanding and results. For example:
- Rough question: _"How can I hack X?"_
- Precise question: _"How can I use the server's SMB service to identify user accounts?"

People often struggle to ask the right questions, but asking the right ones can lead to valuable insights and effective decision-making.

Questions help achieve specific goals:
- **Past:** Understanding the reason for an event.
- **Present:** Learning how something works.
- **Future:** Predicting outcomes.

**Three Core Aspects of Every Question:**
- **Origin:** Where the question comes from.
- **Process:** How the question is framed.
- **Result/Goal:** The purpose or desired outcome.

Question: "A sentence worded or expressed to elicit information."
- **Issue:** This definition focuses on form and overlooks cases where questions do not directly result in acquiring information.
