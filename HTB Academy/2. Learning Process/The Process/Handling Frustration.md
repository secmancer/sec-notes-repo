Frustration is an emotional reaction, usually taking the form of disappointment or powerlessness, and is influenced by expectations or desires.
- It can arise from **external sources** (e.g., negative feedback from superiors) or **internal processes** (e.g., subconscious thought patterns).

**Subconscious Connection**:
- Feelings often reflect subconscious thoughts. By understanding our emotions, we can gain insight into our thought processes.
- A useful technique is to view our thoughts from a third-person perspective or imagine a friend expressing them, allowing for more objectivity.

**Frustration Tolerance**:
- Frustration tolerance varies from person to person, influencing how they react to challenges or setbacks.
- Those with **low frustration tolerance** may give up quickly or become stressed and aggressive when facing unexpected obstacles or delayed success.
- On the other hand, **high frustration tolerance** leads to remaining calm in stressful situations.

**Training Frustration Tolerance**:
- Frustration tolerance can be developed over time by gradually exposing oneself to frustrating situations in a controlled way.
- The goal is to build resilience and the ability to remain calm, even when faced with stress or obstacles.

**Information Security Context**:
- In fields like pentesting or information security, frustration often stems from lacking the necessary resources or skills.
- Training in gathering information and working with different technologies helps reduce this frustration.

**Comfort Zone and Anxiety**:
- Frustration is closely tied to anxiety when we lack the necessary skills or knowledge. The key is to push ourselves outside our comfort zone in a controlled way to grow.

Imagine running late to catch a train. If it is out of your control, frustration will be high due to external factors. However, if you consciously choose to leave late, frustration is lower since the responsibility lies with you.
- This illustrates how conscious decisions can reduce frustration levels.

**Temporary Nature of Frustration**:
- Frustration is a temporary feeling. People often panic or react aggressively, not realizing it will pass.
- Understanding its temporary nature can help us react more calmly and build confidence over time.

**Managing Inner vs. External Frustration**:
- We can control **inner frustration** by practicing emotional regulation and reframing thoughts.
- **External factors**, however, are harder to control, but we can control how we react to them.
