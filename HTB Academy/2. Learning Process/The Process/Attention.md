Attention = perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest in order to gather specific data and information from it. Out attention changes with out experience and information that we gain from content, along with its clarity

> `Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.`

We have a confident attitude, expectation, orientation, and goal when approaching this module
- Attention is an independent mental process that is subconsciously done.

Concentration = maintenance of our attention on a specific topic
- As long as we are interested in a given topic, we keep working on it until the desired result for our well-being is achieved.
- Attention goes hand and hand with concentration and focus.

Attention will being to decrease at a point, resulting in no longer able to absorb as much information as before
- We get stuck at this point, trying to keep going, but ends up in problems and understanding, which leads to high frustration.

Once again: we can't learn everything at once. We need to understand how to divide up our attention effectively

No general formula exists
- It's an individual process that can't be categorized without going into the nitty gritty of it
- Too many personal characteristics and experiences of each individual need to be taken into account for that to happen

Attention takes place at the moment, so has limited duration to it
- Great advantage to learn how long the span lasts

Adding the following points to our documentation can help us get a better insight:
- current emotional state (calm, nervous, worried, happy, depressed, relaxed, etc.)
- the previous flow of the day so far (also with one word)
- place of work
- working hours
- duration
- sleep
- inserted breaks
- duration of the breaks
- and anything else we can think of.

These will require at least one hour of our attention Making it fun will allow us to surprise ourselves in what we discover about it
- Creating a simple list or table for us to document quickly and easily can help as well
- Don't have to document every time we start something, but helps to relate it to the current module/course/path

Once we know our attention span is behaving properly, we can get the idea on splitting it up
- If we have an attention span of 60 minutes, then this doesn't mean we can divide it evenly between 3 other topics.

Experimenting will help you decided.
- Change place of work
- Change work hours
- Change duration of work
- Listen to different music
- Try different techniques that may help

It's best if we didn't force ourselves to focus on a specific topic because it will create a negative effect on us, leading to frustration

> Make sure that you feel comfortable and ready to learn new things.
