Progress is an essential aspect of the learning process. To evaluate progress, one must compare knowledge from two different points in time.
- This comparison helps track growth and confirm new achievements.

**Self-Confirmation vs. External Validation**:
- When self-confirmation of progress is difficult, people may seek validation from others.
- However, external validation is often unreliable, as others have not experienced the exact same journey or circumstances.

**Mountain Climbing Analogy**:
- Progress in learning is like climbing a mountain. Moving uphill is exhausting, but it is the only way to gain height.
- Setbacks like slipping back a bit are normal, but what's essential is to keep moving forward.
- The speed at which one climbs the mountain depends on individual ambition and effort, but stopping means no progress.

**Small Daily Improvements**:
- A 1% improvement per day can lead to significant progress over time. Mathematically:
    - (1.00)^365 = 1.00 (No progress if no improvement is made)
    - (1.01)^365 = 37.7 (A 1% daily improvement leads to a huge difference over a year)

**Tracking Progress**:
- To monitor learning progress, two lists can be created:
    - **List No. 1**: Write down everything you know about a specific topic on a given date. Rate your skills on a scale from 1-10, and make it as detailed as possible. Save this list for future comparison.
    - **List No. 2**: Continuously update this list with new things learned each day. Even small daily learning, like 10 minutes, contributes to long-term growth.

**Reflection on Progress**:
- By reviewing these lists over time, the progress made becomes evident.
- Only through personal reflection can one truly see and appreciate their learning journey, as no one else can accurately assess your individual progress.
