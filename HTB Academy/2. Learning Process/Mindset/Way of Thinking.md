- IT field is huge, literally impossible for one to learn everything that there is
- Here, we are given this example:

> Imagine you want to become a programmer, and you know that there are more than 200 different programming languages that can be used to create applications that can be cracked by debugging or reverse engineering. If we learned every programming language within 100 hours, we would spend 20,000 hours or 2,500 days (8 hours per day) or, in other words, almost seven years to learn all of these programming languages. As a result, we spent seven years learning all these languages and never tried to debug or reverse engineer the program we created. Great! Let us spend another seven years learning to debug and reverse engineering.

- We get it, no one wants to spend everything on just one thing. This is just not necessary
- Time is needed to learn different technical principles, structures, and processes for us to continue growing.
- However, that amount of time is just unnecessary.
- Here, once we learn the deep understanding of one programming language, then we can learn the others much faster
- We will find they all follow these same principles:
	- 1. The Principle of Abstraction
	- 2. The Principle of Correspondence
	- 3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness
- We have to learn and understand these rather quickly along. We also need to find out what we really don't know.
- A ton of information security communities exist around us to help us achieve that.
- We can also develop our research and learning methodologies to improve our knowledge with.
- We become good only through practice
- One common questions we run into is:

> When is a penetration tester good enough?

- We need to learn how to find, choose, and adapt the information we need.
- We are considering three key terms, but one key term is currently missing.
- What is that term? LEARN
- It's not easy to learn how to learn
- We've always just been used to only knowing how to solve issues one way and one way only.

> 20 * ________+ ________ = 65535

- It appears to be easy to solve, but are there other ways to do so?
