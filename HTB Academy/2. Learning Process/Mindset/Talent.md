- We know all about talented people, heck, we might even know some.
- Many believe talent and similar abilities are the true driving force for being successful in their field.
- Talent itself is not innate - ability to solve problems with excellence results is something we are taught and developing in early childhood.
- This talent can be developed much easily then than in adulthood.
- Often, this is since they don't have complicated thinking or complex hurdles they need to come over.
- No precise definition of talent exists as the official definition is it being a natural aptitude or skill
- It can't be valid if we consider it carefully as it would have to apply to any skill at that point.
- Let's ask the following then:

> Who among the several million students on Hack The Box can naturally fly an airplane?

- Taking off an airplane requires a great amount of technical knowledge, which then can also differ since different airplanes may be manufactured differently
- Maybe someone can start it and move it a bit, but taking off surely requires much more knowledge than pure talent can pull from.
- No one knows how to fly an airplane naturally.
- Talented individuals are defined as highly efficient and perform exceptionally well in their individual fields of expertise.
- Such talents are created from persistent confrontation with the situations and problems that the person runs into.
- Despite this, it doesn't have to be precisely the one situation to develop talent, but rather develop the thinking pattern in helping to solve problems.
- This expands the comfort zone and repertoire, which can allow us to think more easily and tackle the challenge or problem.
- Basically, talent is trained and adapted thought process and the associated patterns for specific fields and situations.
- We know we can have a good influence on our own thought processes and patterns, in which we can influence them according to our own decisions.
- We are absolutely not born with them, we take time to learn and perfect them, like how a musician takes time to learn how to play their choice of instrument.
- Like how many skills are needed to learn a bass guitar, different areas of cybersecurity also require the learning and usage of many different skills.
- Developing this talent in childhood early on depends on the environment they are in, and how much the parent is willing to put in. However, it should be noted that we ourselves are in the ultimate control of developing our own talents through us actively seeking them.
- Ultimately, we have a lot of talents already in side of us, we just need some training and practice to bring those out and really harden them.
