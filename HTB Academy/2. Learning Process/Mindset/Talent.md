- We know all about talented people, heck, we might even know some.
- Many believe talent and similar abilities are the true driving force for being successful in their field.
- Talent itself is not innate - ability to solve problems with excellence results is something we are taught and developing in early childhood.
- This talent can be developed much easily then than in adulthood.
- Often, this is since they don't have complicated thinking or complex hurdles they need to come over.
- No precise definition of talent exists as the official definition is it being a natural aptitude or skill
- It can't be valid if we consider it carefully as it would have to apply to any skill at that point.
- Let's ask the following then:

> Who among the several million students on Hack The Box can naturally fly an airplane?

- Taking off an airplane requires a great amount of technical knowledge, which then can also differ since different airplanes may be manufactured differently
- Maybe someone can start it and move it a bit, but taking off surely requires much more knowledge than pure talent can pull from.
- No one knows how to fly an airplane naturally.
- Talented individuals are defined as highly efficient and perform exceptionally well in their individual fields of expertise.
