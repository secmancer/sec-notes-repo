- Outside the box thinking helps us to cross imaginary boundaries and allows us to access options/possibilities that we didn't see at first.
- Occam's Razor is a principle beneficial for making these circumstances much easier to digest.
- This principle is based on the definition:

> `The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

- Example: our computer stops working. Many reasons can be brought to us for why this happen. With this, we then go into this long process of elimination and going down into the nitty gritty of it to find our problem.
- However, instead of that, why not we just ask yourself:
	- Why is our computer not getting power?
- We can automatically form associations in our minds when we ask this question. From there, we can focus on the power supply.
- We must not forget though to think outside of the box on what might be happening here.
- From this approach, we can get to the issue of it being the power supply much faster.

### Occam's Razor in Practice
- Using this can be much harder in practice
- This is since well... the problem isn't always what it appears at face value, it can get much more complicated than that
- However, despite that, we will always being learning something new through these problems.
- Example: getting familiar with SQL injection may have us find the individual steps very difficult to produce at first
	- Once we get understanding of the overall concept, it gets easy for us to become good at knowing when a web app is vulnerable to SQL injections.
	- We can also understand that individual steps and exploit them are very complicated indeed, but are the same in concept. Our goal is to always improve and learn new topics.
- Example: penetration testing approach. Everyone has their favorite approach, discussing cases that occur and what they use to solve them.
	- Each penetration testing is unique, even if tests have similar systems.
	- Configuration, however, is very unique often or not between tests.
	- These unique details are stages in a penetration test.
	- We can ultimately boil it down to:

> `The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.`

- Our unique techniques are gained through the individual steps we follow. You can apply the same idea to most exploitation attacks and their own individual steps for them.
- Getting the overall picture, adapting to given situations/conditions become much, much easier. However, if we have only learned the steps, we will have difficulty having them adapted to new situations we haven't come across before as we wouldn't understand their true impact on the systems and their applications
- We will continue to see this over and over again. Once the problem is identified, the solution, process, and steps to achieve it become straightforward in a lot of cases.
- We are doing the art of finding the way to the flag than more so the flag itself.
