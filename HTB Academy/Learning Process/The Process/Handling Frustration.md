1. **Types of Frustration**:
    - **External Frustration**: Results from outside influences, such as criticism or obstacles that hinder our progress.
    - **Internal Frustration**: Originates from our own thoughts, beliefs, and expectations.


1. **Subconscious Thoughts**:
    - Our feelings of frustration often reflect underlying subconscious thoughts. By examining these thoughts from a distance (e.g., as if they were someone elseâ€™s), we can gain clarity and objectivity.


1. **Frustration Tolerance**:
    - **Low Tolerance**: Individuals with low frustration tolerance may react quickly with stress or avoidance when faced with difficulties.
    - **High Tolerance**: Those with high tolerance manage stress better and persist through challenges.

### Building Frustration Tolerance
1. **Controlled Exposure**:
    - Deliberately place yourself in challenging situations to practice and increase your frustration tolerance. This should be done consciously and with a clear understanding of the situation.


1. **Skill Development**:
    - In fields like cybersecurity, having the skills and knowledge to handle situations can reduce feelings of frustration. Continuous learning and practice are key.


1. **Mindset Shift**:
    - Recognize that frustration is temporary. Instead of reacting aggressively, focus on analyzing and learning from the situation.

### Practical Example
1. **Scenario 1: Unexpected Train Delay**
    - You miss the train due to unforeseen delays or external factors. Frustration might be high because the situation was out of your control.


1. **Scenario 2: Deliberate Late Departure**
    - You consciously leave late and try to catch the train. Even if you miss it, the frustration level might be lower because you had control over the situation and can analyze your decision-making.

### Conclusion
- **Frustration as a Temporary State**: Understand that frustration is a passing emotion. By facing it head-on and using it as a learning experience, you can strengthen your self-confidence and improve your ability to handle stress.
    
- **Focus on Skills and Mindset**: Enhance your skills to reduce frustration related to lack of information or capability, and develop a mindset that views frustration as a temporary and manageable state.
