1. **Comparison of States**:
    - Comparing your current knowledge and skills with your past state helps you see progress. This involves evaluating where you were at a specific point in the past and measuring how far you’ve come since then.


1. **Self-Assessment vs. External Validation**:
    - Often, seeking validation from others may not be as effective because they may not fully understand the context of your journey. Personal progress is best assessed through your own reflection and records.


1. **Continuous Effort and Incremental Improvement**:
    - Even small, consistent improvements can lead to significant progress over time. The mathematical example you provided demonstrates how incremental changes (e.g., a 1% daily improvement) can compound to create substantial results.

### Practical Application
1. **Two Lists for Tracking Progress**:
    **List No. 1: Baseline Assessment**
    - Create a comprehensive list of your current knowledge and skills related to your goal. Use a scale (e.g., 1-10) to rate your proficiency in various areas.
    - **Details**: Include specific skills, knowledge areas, and any relevant metrics. For example, in cybersecurity, this might include specific tools, techniques, or concepts.
    - **Storage**: Save this list in a place where it can be easily accessed for future comparison, such as a digital file or a journal.
    
    **List No. 2: Continuous Learning Log**
    - Maintain an ongoing record of new knowledge and skills you acquire. Update this list regularly, ideally documenting new entries as soon as you learn something new.
    - **Details**: Note down the date, the new information or skill, and any relevant details about how you learned it.
    - **Calendar Weeks**: For a more structured approach, you can organize entries by calendar weeks or months to track learning over time.


1. **Visualization of Progress**:
    - Regularly review both lists to visualize your growth. Compare your baseline assessment with your continuous learning log to see how much you’ve improved.
    - **Reflection**: Periodically assess your progress against your initial baseline to understand how your skills and knowledge have developed.


1. **Goal Setting and Adjustment**:
    - Use the insights from your progress tracking to set new goals and adjust your learning strategies. For example, if you notice significant improvement in one area, you might decide to focus on another skill.


1. **Self-Compassion and Persistence**:
    - Recognize that progress is not always linear. There will be periods of rapid growth and times when progress seems slow. Maintain self-compassion and persistence throughout your journey.
