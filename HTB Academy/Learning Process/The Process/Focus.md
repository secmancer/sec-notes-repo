**Understanding Focus:**
- **Definition:** Concentrating most of your thinking and attention on a specific topic, while other thoughts fade away.
- **Dual Nature:** Focus can be both beneficial and challenging.

**Impact of Physical Activity on Stress:**
- **Example:** People often go to the gym after a stressful day.
    - **Reasoning:** Physical activity produces endorphins, which have various benefits:
        - Reduce pain
        - Provide a calming effect
        - Regulate hunger
        - Strengthen the immune system
    - **Mental Relief:** Physical focus during exercise diverts attention from stress, allowing subconscious processing of problems.

**Focus vs. Attention:**
- **Attention:** The immediate, present momentum of what you are engaged in.
- **Focus:** The deliberate alignment to a specific goal or topic.
    - Example: Misplaced keys.
        - **Focus on Keys:** You concentrate on finding them.
        - **Focus on Being Late:** Distracts from the task, making it harder to find the keys.

**Benefits of Focus:**
- **Purposeful Alignment:** Focus is a conscious or subconscious decision influenced by will and external factors.
- **Characteristics of Focused Individuals:**
    - Persistent and tenacious
    - Less prone to distractions
    - More efficient in achieving goals
