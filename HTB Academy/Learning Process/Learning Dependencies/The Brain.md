- **The Brain:**
    - **Fascinating Organ:** Integral to who we are, yet remains largely unexplored.
    - **Common Myths:**
        - **Myth 1:** We use only 5-10% of our brainpower. **Reality:** All regions of the brain are active, as shown by EEG and fMRI studies.
        - **Myth 2:** The speed at which we learn determines our intelligence. **Reality:** Brain regions responsible for complex logical tasks develop around age 20 (+/- 2 years).


- **Development of Cognitive Abilities:**
    - **Einstein Example:** Known for slow learning in school, particularly in math, yet became a genius in his field, showing that intelligence and learning speed are not directly correlated.
    - **"Computer Nerd" Stereotype:** Reflects the development of specific brain regions, showing that expertise in one area can coincide with deficits in others due to differential brain development.


- **Cognitive Science and Thought:**
    - **Interdisciplinary Field:** Studies conscious and subconscious processes such as memory, perception, and problem-solving.
    - **Thought:** Though cognitive science has not definitively proven what a thought is, it is clear that the brain is constantly producing thoughts.

### The Theory of Thought
- **Personal Definition of Thought:**
    - **Thought Process:** An individual action/reaction to internal or external influences, where information is interpreted and linked based on personal methodology developed over a lifetime.
    - **Example:** "Scotland has 421 words for 'snow.'" This triggers a reaction (surprise) and an internal process of linking this new information with existing knowledge (e.g., Scotland, snow, language).


- **Associations and Memory:**
    - **Node Connections:** Information is stored and retrieved in the brain through associative links (e.g., Scotland - Snow - 421 - Words).
    - **Memory and Thought Processing:** Our memory works through these association chains within our neuronal networks.

### Conscious vs. Subconscious Thoughts
- **Conscious Thoughts:**
    - **Consciousness Defined:** The totality of mental processes by which we become aware of our external and internal world through active observation.
    - **Example:** Actively reading text on a monitor and deciding to look elsewhere if desired.


- **Unconscious Thoughts:**
    - **Subconscious Processing:** Thoughts we do not perceive directly but influence our actions through emotions.
    - **Decision-Making:** Studies show that the subconscious mind can make decisions up to 30 seconds before we are consciously aware of them.
    - **Libet's Experiments:** Demonstrated that the duration of brain activity affects whether a stimulus is consciously perceived.
        - **Example:** When a stimulus lasted less than 500 milliseconds, subjects were not consciously aware of it, but they could guess the correct outcome with a higher probability than chance.

### Summary of Key Points
- **The Brain and Learning:**
    - **Myths Dispelled:** Brain activity is constant, and learning speed does not equal intelligence.
    - **Cognitive Abilities:** Develop at different rates, with complex logical thinking maturing in early adulthood.


- **Thoughts and Learning:**
    - **Definition of Thought:** A process of reacting to influences, shaped by individual experiences and associations.
    - **Conscious vs. Subconscious:** Consciousness involves active awareness, while the subconscious processes information that influences decisions before we are aware.
