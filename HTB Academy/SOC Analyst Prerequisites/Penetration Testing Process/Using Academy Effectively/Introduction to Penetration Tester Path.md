**Overview of the Module:**
- This module introduces the Penetration Tester Job Role Path.
- It covers penetration tests and the phases involved, recommending this module as a starting point and reference guide.
- Suitable for both aspiring and experienced penetration testers to upskill and understand the process holistically.

**Target Audience:**
- Aspiring penetration testers and professionals looking to become more well-rounded or gain new perspectives.
- Covers External and Internal Penetration Tests, including network, Active Directory, and Web Application Security Assessments.

**Content and Learning Structure:**
- Modules dive into specialized techniques, methodologies, and tools for penetration testing.
- Hands-on learning with a capstone module simulating a full penetration test.
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind techniques and issues, not just tool usage.

**HTB Academy Learning Philosophy:**
- Emphasis on "learn by doing" with a risk-based, hands-on approach.
- Legal and ethical practices are stressed, particularly the importance of performing authorized tests.
- Focus on developing a repeatable methodology applicable to various assessments and environments.
- Practical examples and scenarios are integrated throughout the course.
  
**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**
- Ensure all testing is within legal boundaries, with proper written consent and scope of work.
- Participation in bug bounty programs is encouraged for further real-world practice.
- Important to verify the legitimacy of companies before performing assessments.
- Always document and obtain explicit consent in writing for any activities.
