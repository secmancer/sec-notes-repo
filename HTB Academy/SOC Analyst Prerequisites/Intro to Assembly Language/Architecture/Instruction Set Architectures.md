## Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) Notes

### **Overview of ISA**
- An **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** defines the **syntax and semantics** of assembly language for a specific processor architecture.
- It dictates how instructions are processed, their complexity, and the execution order.
  
### **Main Components of ISA**
1. **Instructions**: Defines the operation to be executed in an **opcode operand_list** format.
   - Example: `add rax, 1`, `mov rsp, rax`
2. **Registers**: Temporary storage for operands, addresses, or instructions.
   - Example: `rax`, `rsp`, `rip`
3. **Memory Addresses**: Specifies where data or instructions are stored.
   - Example: `0xffffffffaa8a25ff`, `0x44d0`, `$rax`
4. **Data Types**: Defines the format of the data being processed.
   - Example: `byte`, `word`, `double word`

### **Types of Instruction Set Architectures**
1. **Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)**
   - **Used by**: Intel and AMD processors in most computers and servers.
   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - Executes **complex instructions** to minimize the number of total instructions.
     - Combines multiple smaller operations into **one instruction cycle** (fetch-decode-execute-store).
     - Ideal for **shorter programs**, making efficient use of **limited memory** and **transistor resources**.
     - **Trade-off**: More complex instructions take **more clock cycles**, resulting in **higher power consumption** and **heat**.

2. **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)**
   - **Used by**: ARM processors, Apple processors, most smartphones, and some modern laptops.
   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - Breaks complex instructions into **simpler operations**.
     - CPU handles only **simple instructions**, pushing **optimization** to the **software** (assembly code).
     - Each simple instruction is executed in a **single clock cycle** (fetch-decode-execute-store).
     - More total instructions are required, leading to **longer assembly code**.
     - **Benefit**: Fixed-length instructions (32-bit or 64-bit) make the CPU **more power-efficient**, consuming **less power**.

### **CISC Architecture**
- **Purpose**: Reduce the number of instructions executed by combining simpler ones into complex instructions.
- **Example**: The instruction `add rax, rbx` in CISC executes in a single instruction cycle, performing **fetch**, **decode**, **execute**, and **store** all at once.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - **Efficient use of limited resources** in earlier computing (limited memory and transistor counts).
  - Requires **fewer instructions** per program, making code **shorter**.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex instructions take **more clock cycles** to execute.
  - Leads to **higher power consumption** and **heat generation** due to the complexity of processing units within the CPU.

### **RISC Architecture**
- **Purpose**: Break down complex tasks into **simpler instructions** that the CPU can handle quickly and efficiently.
- **Example**: To add two registers, a RISC processor might split the task into multiple instructions (fetch `r1`, fetch `r2`, add `r1, r2`, store result).
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Each instruction is **simpler** and executed in a **single clock cycle**.
  - **Fixed-length instructions** enable the CPU to optimize its clock speed.
  - Consumes **less power** than CISC, ideal for battery-powered devices (smartphones, laptops).

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Programs require **more total instructions**, leading to **longer code**.
  - **Fewer supported instructions** (around 200 compared to CISC's ~1500).
