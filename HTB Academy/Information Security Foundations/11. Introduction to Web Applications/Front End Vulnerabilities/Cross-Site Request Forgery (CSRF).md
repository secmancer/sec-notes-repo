**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities and Prevention**
- **Definition**:
    - CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in a user's browser. By tricking a victim into executing malicious requests on a web application where they are authenticated, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **How CSRF Works**:
    - **Exploitation**: CSRF attacks can leverage existing vulnerabilities, including XSS or HTTP parameter attacks, to make unauthorized requests as an authenticated user.
    - **Example**: A common attack involves embedding JavaScript payloads in malicious content (e.g., comments) that automatically execute when viewed by the victim. This script might change the victim's password or perform other actions using their current session.
- **Attacking Admins**:
    - CSRF can target admin accounts, which often have elevated privileges. Successful attacks might allow attackers to perform actions that could compromise the back end server or perform administrative functions maliciously.
- **Example of CSRF Payload**:
    - **JavaScript Payload**: `<script src=//www.example.com/exploit.js></script>`
        - **Details**: `exploit.js` contains malicious code that changes the victim's password or performs other unauthorized actions. The payload relies on the victim being logged in and executing the JavaScript code within their session.
- **Prevention**:
    - **Sanitization**: Remove special and non-standard characters from user input before displaying or storing it to prevent injection attacks.
    - **Validation**: Ensure user input matches the expected format, such as validating email addresses or other data fields.
    - **Sanitizing Output**: Clear special or non-standard characters from output to avoid rendering malicious content.
    - **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Implement a WAF to detect and block injection attempts. However, rely on WAFs as a supplementary measure, not the primary defense.
    - **Anti-CSRF Measures**:
        - **Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Use tokens that must be included in forms and requests to verify that they originate from the legitimate user.
        - **HTTP Headers**: Utilize `X-Requested-With` headers or other security headers to identify and prevent unauthorized requests.
        - **Browser Measures**: Many modern browsers have built-in anti-CSRF protections, like same-site cookies and blocking automatic script execution.
- **Additional Notes**:
    - **Functional Measures**: Implement additional security checks, such as requiring re-authentication before performing sensitive actions like password changes.
    - **Best Practices**: Always follow coding best practices to minimize vulnerability to CSRF and related attacks.
