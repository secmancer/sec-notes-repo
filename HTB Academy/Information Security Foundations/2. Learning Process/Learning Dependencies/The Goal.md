- Goal: state that lies in the future, generally changed from the present, desirable, that we aspire to fulfill.
- A goal is thus a defined and desired endpoint of a process.
- Therefore, it must be possible to determine precisely from the formulation of the goal what the desired state must be for a goal to be considered achieved.

Different types of goals:

- For every single goal, dozens of different formulas and models have been created to achieve them in the best possible way.
- Finding a suitable model that firs out personal needs, experiences, and goals it not a very easy process
- Each models have a different focus, and to find the perfect model for us, we would have to study each and try them out for a more extended time.
- Biggest problem is we are forced to abandoned one of the models because we do not know if the model will lead us to our goal
- If we fell comfortable with this model, then it doesn't mean it is effective and will lead us to the goal
- We would have to try another model to find out
- Without knowing the rest of the models, we would have try all the others, which can be very time-consuming

Results from over 200 results with more than 40,000 participants show that over 90% of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting challenging and specific goals
- We cannot emphasize strongly enough the important of setting a clear goal for ourselves

What do we want? Do we want:
- Pass an exam?
- Obtain a certification?
- Learn and master new skills?
- Or impress and please others?

We will take different paths depending on the goal we have set for ourselves.
- Big difference between passing an exam or just getting the certification for it
- Many think the cert will prove the trained skills have been acquired.
- However, the cert if a formal and official acknowledgement of participation in particular training
- If we only want to get the cert or even just the confirmation of having completed something, we will look for easier ways to get closer to the goal as quickly as possible.
- Decisions are made to ask someone how certain tasks are solved in order not to have to think about it.

Avoid our own "thinking" doesn't allow us the possibility of creating chains of associations in our brain.
- These association chains are the links in our brain cells that serve our thinking processes and information links by which we learn to solve problems or situations.
Basically, we deprive ourselves the ability to learn something new and to develop further.

A task or goal helps us influence how we think

Another aspect that we can look at is how to reach this goal. 
- If we think about it, none of the current "great" and well-known personalities will be able to say that they knew the path that led them to the goal beforehand.
- Not many people knew that, but what they did know was the goal that they had set for themselves.

Someone who claims his way is the only right way should stick to that if it works for themselves
 - There are no other ways may be true for that person, but it does not mean that others cannot do it.
 - If a person doesn't know how to use a ladder, they will only get to higher floors with outside help.

No matter what goal we have in mind, we must decide on it.
