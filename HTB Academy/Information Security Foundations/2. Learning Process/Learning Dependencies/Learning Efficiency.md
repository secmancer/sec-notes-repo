- Problem here: sheer size of the IT/cybersecurity field we are dealing with
- As with the previous examples, there are a lot to learn and many topics to cover within technical areas like programming and informational technology.
- Courses will be very technical, which is good for strengthening our skillsets
- We need to understand how things work, how they are structured, and how to use them effectively.
- Everything we need to be successful is out there, we just need to go get it.
- Primary/most difficult objective: overcoming the combination of our knowledge, adaptation, and new information
- Not easy to find what we need, where is what kind we need to know:
	- What do we already know?`
	- What do we not know yet?`
- Even with this info that we do find, we still don't know how to use it yet.
- Another problem is how we must handle this massive amount of info and adapting it into our strengths and weaknesses.

Take this scenario:

> A student wants to learn how to assemble an engine. Before a student "can" assemble an engine, they start learning many theoretical concepts to prevent failure.

- We first of all, have to fail. This is the most unavoidable and essential part of learning. This is one of the parts that will make us successful.
- Experience is built on failures, as it examples how we need to handle different and sometimes adverse situations where something does not work as expected.
- We will learn what we need, how to use it, and how to work with it, as it will allow us to see what kind of things can happen, collect our first practical experience, and improve our existing skills.
- When taught with support and shown how to do something, a student can know how to do it independently, while also being able to learn all about the theoretical aspects more in-depth through proper practice and repetition.

We will learn penetration testing basics, but also how to:
- Learn faster
- Structure our knowledge
- Find the information we need
- Get the overview

Many companies are searching for good penetration testers and information security specialists to join their ranks, which begs the question:

> "However, what does it mean to be good?"

- For us to be good, we must know what we are doing.
- If we have that, then we can be experienced with that topic
- Experience means we can have a vast repertoire in the field, which comes from associations and practical experience additionally.
- When we say practical experience, we of course want to know how much we have to practice in order to become competent at a specific task.
- There is something called the 10,000-Hour rule, which essentially boils down to you spending 10,000 hours equates to being good at something. We, of course, don't want to be spend 10,000 hours learning just one skill.
- Instead, we can look into something called the Pareto Principle, or 80/20 for something much more achievable.
- It states that 20% of effort allows us to achieve 80% of the effect.
- Conversely, this means 80% of the effort, we can achieve 20% of the effect, which is 100% missing.
- We need to note though that it does not apply to everything, but can be used as a general rule applied to specific areas.
- We can become excellent pretty fast, with the learning curve with active/passing learning being applied effectively
- We can learn this with the Learning Pyramid.
