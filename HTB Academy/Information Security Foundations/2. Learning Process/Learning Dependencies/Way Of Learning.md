Now, back to the original math problem:


```
20 * ________+ ________ = 65535
```


- Remember, we are learned to perform the calculation one way, in which we use the patterns we are used to figure this out.
- However, we need to use our new art form we have just learned: thinking outside the box, which is essential for the "hacker mindset"
- We're going to have to pivot here and think of possible, like easier methods to solve the above problem.
- As stated:

> `A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.`

- The learning process is not so clear theoretical/practical.
- It highly depends on our emotional state: we are to be more successful with a clear and calm mind than the opposite.
- We also need to know our goal to overcoming this challenge:

Take this scenario:

> You're standing still in a room, and your instructor instructs you to move across the room, and you start moving. After a while, the instructor put a chair in your way. What will you do? - You may sit down on this chair.

We can change this scenario to something like this:

> Your instructor instructs you to move to the other corner. We start moving, and the instructor puts a chair in our way again. What will we do? You will pass the chair and continue moving forward to the corner because you know your goal.

- The biggest difference between the two is what we know our goal and know how we need to move on. We need to overcome the obstacles which are put in our way
- Having no goal doesn't allow us to surpass the first obstacle. We would instead just distract ourselves from one topic to another.
