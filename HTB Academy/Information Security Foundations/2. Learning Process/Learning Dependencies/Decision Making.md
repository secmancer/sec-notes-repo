Decision-making process in which we make our decisions about certain situations we are in is a very extensive and complicated subject on which there are multiple studies and disagreements on it
- Many theories/phases have been created to facilitate a better overview of the thought processes of the brain
- It is far from easy to define such phases as each individual thought processes and patterns.

A decision is the choice of one of several options.
- Made based on the importance of the circumstances
- We make them based on what we expect to get the most out of it.
- Thus, they're are made not only rationally, but also emotionally.

Assuming we have spontaneously been given a day off by our employer and a friend has asked us for help, we are now faced with choosing want we want to use our available time for, either for a project at work for a salary increase or helping out a friend move
- If our well being is more important than income, then we can choose to help with the move
- On the other hand, income might be more important, resulting in us choosing the project

Decision psychology establishes that people by no means behave exclusively in terms of cost-benefit considerations.
- A person's decision-making behavior can be understood as a process in which rationality occurs only to a limited extent.


### The Trolley Problem
- Thought experiment in which three different scenarios have occupied many philosophers, psychologists, and legal scholars for decades.

> A train speeds unbraked toward a group of five-track workers. The switchman might divert the train to a siding where only one person is working. Should he sacrifice one person to save five others?

Social and Personality Psychology Compass criticized it since it is too extreme
- If we stay in there, the decision will be tricky
- They believe this since people cannot be expected to make such decisions, and it is basically "impossible" to make a correct decision.
- This statement has many different reasons, like the below:
	- it is an enormous psychological burden before, during, and after the decision for the respective person.
	- the persons representing this statement do not see a solution for this situation.
	- and many other reasons based on personal experience.

We can use something similar with the math problem that we were working with originally: `20 * ________ + ________ = 65535`
- This is since we appear to only have two options at first:
	- either we switch tracks, and the train runs over one person
	- or we do nothing, and five people are run over by the train.
- For our specific math example, we get:
	- either we place it on the first open digit
	- or we place it on the second.
- Both cases have their procedure changed, but the result remains the same

Math example: result is 65,535
Trolley problem: someone is ran over

Red lines = ropes, blue circles = pillars

First thing that comes to mind is:
- "But we are not allowed to place pillars" or
- "We are only allowed to press the switch."
However, no one has told us whether we are allowed to move or not.
- We set our limitations ourselves, not by others.
- It is the same as if as stranger on the street were to tell us that we are suddenly not allowed to move while walking.
- Except for the fact we will look at the person strangely, we will still walk

If we learn to set limits based on facts, decisions get much easier and more effective.

If we take a closer look at the trolley problem, the first questions arise:
- How far away is the train?
- How fast is the train going?
- How much time do we have to try to save everyone?
- How can we save everyone?
- What tools do we have at our disposal?

Taking a closer look, we can see that these factors are not given at all. They're missing like in the math problem.
- No one has said we must not change the circumstances for this
- Additional example would be if all the people on the tracks are conscious, we could save them all by warning them to get off the tracks as quickly as possible.

Let's say the train will arrive in 10 seconds, it doesn't mean we have to choose one of the options given to us.
- Absolute extreme solution would be flipping the switch while the train passes over it.
- This is called "double-tracking" and will likely derail the train, saving the people.

We need to know factors and access the consequences in making a decision
- The more factors we know, the more precise the decision we will be able to make for our goal

If someone tells us something is impossible, this person cannot possibly know all factors with which we are connected.
- Just because the person believes that they see no solution for a task or goal, it means that the person does not see a solution or a way to achieve the goal
- Many may accept this, but transfer this attitude to themselves, which leads to the fact that the desired goal or even the attempt to already given up
- This results in people failing before they even try.

If we don't know what to do in one thing or another , the reason is that we have not gathered enough facts to make a good decision.
- However, once we have gathered enough data, we can better calculate what result we will achieve in the end, and based on the facts we have gathered, we open up possibilities and paths we can take.

This means no one will ever be able to question your success if you:
- Decide on the goal defined in detail that you really want to achieve from your heart, and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously.
