We need to first determine the report audience.
- We will document our activities differently than we would present our results to a customer

Purpose of documentation = present information we have obtained in a comprehensible way to reproduce a specific activity

Essential characteristics of documentation:
- Overview
- Structure
- Clarity

As we learn and practice, there will be many different situations and resources we'll run into.
- We will have to process massive amounts of information.

Tools like CherryTree for organizing notes can be helpful.
- Screenshot tools like FlameShot can also help in taking screenshots of data and editing them easily.

We also can have some guidelines we can follow:
- It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
- Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
- Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.
