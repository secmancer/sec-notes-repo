Imagine the following situation:

> You are standing on a big mountain, and at the bottom of the mountain, there is a vast forest. On the horizon, we see another mountain we want to reach. The difficulty here is that we will not see this mountain as soon as we go down into the forest. The only way to reach the mountain is to orient ourselves using the lakes, rivers, and fields between these two mountains.

This means we should have all of the necessary tools with us and set all the interim orientation points to avoid getting lost.
- That way, as soon as we get lost, we cannot move through the forest disoriented in hoping to reach out goal somehow

We can see how terms depend on each other and how important it is to have a map to orient ourselves.
- By doing the previous exercises, we already made the first drawings on our map
- This helps in understanding where we are and where we want to go
- Being organized is significant in helping the report writing process

May take a single day to take over several systems
- Therefore, it's not adequate to keep looking for sources of information we need over and over again. Organized notes help us avoid that.

Organization best described in the following example:
- An **inexperienced** woodcutter takes 30 minutes to sharpen his axe and 3 hours to cut down the tree.
- The **experienced** one will sharpen the axe for 3 hours and cut down the tree within 30 minutes.

There are many different management techniques and methods that we can use.
- This includes: Scrum, Agile, Todo-Lists, Bullet Journal
