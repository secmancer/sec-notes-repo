Comfort: emotional state of a person's mind
- Strong influence on behavior, thinking, focus, attention, and the ability to concentrate
- The feeling of well-being in the form of comfort and attitude of risk-free 
- This is also called the comfort zone, which the person thinks he/she is located.

**Yerkes-Dodson Law**
- Cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness
- Performance curve is also individual for this, as it depends on emotional/motivational factors
- Divided into 4 sections

For comfort, it depends on whether we have a healthy level of stress or have already crossed the threshold.
- If it goes overboard, then a reduction in performance is seen.
- We are in an area that we are used to and conformable in.
- Mostly these types of situations/fields are ones we gained a certain amount of experience in, so we know how to find our way within them.

Leaving the comfort zone allows us to enter a situation/field where we have little or no experience.
- This lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which in turn, slows us down

Mistakes are essential part of the learning process. We need to keep this in mind

> Now imagine you are standing at the entrance in front of a massive dark forest in the middle of the night. This forest is so dense that no daylight can get through the treetops. To the left and right of this forest, some cliffs are much too steep to climb down, and we know that somewhere in this forest, there is the one thing we want to have. Will you go inside and look for it? Common sense would do anything not to.
  
But what if the thing you want is a hundred yards further into the forest, and it is brightly lit?  
That is the thing that will fulfill you the way we have always wanted it to.  
Would you risk it now?

Those who leave the comfort zone would reach their destination faster than those who don't.
- They would have never sprinted at such speeds before.
