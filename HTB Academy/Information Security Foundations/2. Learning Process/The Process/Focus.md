Focus is a vital skill we need, but can be a double edged sword
- We are talking about focusing on a subject for a specific time, where we devote most of our thinking and attention onto it
- This will cause other topics to be faded out in favor of the focused on.

Have we ever wondered why most frustrated people go straight to the gym after a stressful day instead of just lying down and doing nothing? 
- Why do they feel better afterward? 
- Often we hear from them that they absolutely need it to calm down again. 
- If you think about it a bit, it seems illogical at first because these people need additional physical energy in an exhausted state.

This brings up the question: "Why further physical effort helps them to calm down?"
- On one hand, endorphins are produced by the body when doing workouts.
- These have different effects on the body and one of them is the reduction of pain.
- Chemical transmitters have a calming effect and ensure a restful sleep
- Another effect of endorphins is the strengthening of the immune system, not only on the physical, but also on the psychological level

As focus turns away from the actual stress, we let go of those situations and these are subconsciously processed and, for the most part, solved. Here is an excellent example of that:

> You have probably forgotten where you put something, or you can't think of a specific term that is so obvious to you. Have you ever asked yourself why you can suddenly remember it after a short time?

We distracted ourselves and focused on a different topic
- We gave our subconscious the possibility to solve the problem by itself.

Essential to differentiate focus and attention as they are not the same.
- Attention refers to the momentum as it's happening right now
- Focus is something you are dealing with at the moment

When we return to the misplaced keys example, try to remember what was going through your mind. Something like this:

> "Where did I put the keys?" or "Where did I last see them?"

If these were the questions we were asking ourselves, we could see from the questions along that it is the subject of the keys, and therefore our main focus.

If you ever said to yourself in this situation:

> "OK, the keys are not here..."

We had complete our attention on searching for the keys at that point.
- What if in a hurry?
- Then our thoughts are already on where we expected to be soon as we nervously check the time.
- It'll be hard to concentrate on the search for the keys as your attention drifts elsewhere
Attention and focus are not the same and that attention is influenced by focus.

Focus is based on our will and what we want to achieve.
- Can be a conscious decision and a subconscious decision guided by external influences

Focused people are not just persistent, but also hardly distracted as well
- If you know your goal, it's easier to align our focus.
- This in turn makes us more efficient, and we get closer to our goal much faster in the end.
