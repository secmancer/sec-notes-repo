**Customer Commissioning**:
- The company has been hired by Inlane Freight to perform external and internal penetration tests.
- Proper OS preparation is required before starting the penetration test to avoid delays.

**Penetration Test Variations**:
- Tests differ based on scope, expected results, and environment (customerâ€™s service line and infrastructure).
- Penetration testing activities vary depending on the type of test, either extending or limiting the working environment and capabilities.

**Internal Penetration Test Preparation**:
- Provided with an internal host to work from, often with internet access.
- A Virtual Private Server (VPS) with tools is needed for quick access and downloading resources.
- Test can be conducted remotely or on-site based on the client's preference.

**Remote Penetration Testing Setup**:
- Remote testing involves shipping a device pre-installed with the penetration testing distro or providing a custom VM.
- The VM calls back to the company's infrastructure via OpenVPN.
- The client may host an image, giving SSH access through IP whitelisting or providing VPN access to the network.
- Some clients provide VPN access, allowing tests from local Linux and Windows VMs.

**On-Site Penetration Testing Setup**:
- On-site penetration testing requires both customized and up-to-date Linux and Windows VMs.
- Linux VMs are essential for certain tools, while Windows VMs make tasks like Active Directory enumeration easier.
- Pen testers must guide clients on the best setup based on network and testing requirements.

**Versatility and Adaptability**:
- Pen testers must be prepared on day 1 with proper tools for an in-depth assessment.
- Every environment presents different challenges, so flexibility is key.
- Tools may need to be compiled, installed, or downloaded as the assessment progresses.
- Proper tool preparation minimizes wasted time at the start of the assessment.

**Setup and Efficiency**:
- Having an organized and structured toolset enhances efficiency.
- A pre-baked environment eliminates the need to search for resources or install additional tools during the engagement.
- Knowledge of various operating systems and preparation is crucial to streamline the testing process.
