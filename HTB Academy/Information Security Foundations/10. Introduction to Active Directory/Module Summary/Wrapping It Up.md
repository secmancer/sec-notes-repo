### Active Directory (AD) Overview
- **Importance of Active Directory**: 
  - Central to technical information security roles.
  - Essential for:
    - Hardening and administration as a security-focused sysadmin.
    - Attacking as a network pentester.
    - Defending as a threat hunter.
    - Incident response or digital forensics.

### Foundation of Knowledge
- **Key Terms**: Understanding common AD terminology is crucial as these concepts will recur in various Academy modules, training courses, and in the infosec field.

### Learning Paths
- **Penetration Tester Path**: 
  - Module: **Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks**
    - Focuses on manual and automated enumeration and attack techniques relevant in real-world scenarios.
- **Active Directory Enumeration Path**:
  - Modules Include:
    - **Active Directory LDAP**
    - **Active Directory PowerView**
    - **Active Directory BloodHound**

### Practical Experience
- **Hack The Box (HTB)**: 
  - Targets for practicing AD enumeration and attacks include:
    - **Active**
    - **Resolute**
    - **Forest**
    - **Cascade**
  - Ippsec provides recorded videos that explain paths through these boxes.

### Advanced Learning Opportunities
- **Pro Labs**:
