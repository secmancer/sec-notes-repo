### What is a Module?
- A `module` is the core building block within HTB Academy, and represents a single course that covers a specific topic. 
- Modules consist of multiple `sections`, as mentioned previously, and a group of modules make a `path`.
- You can click on any module in the [Modules](https://academy.hackthebox.com/modules) page to preview its summary, which mentions what the module covers, what is the expected outcome, and what are the requirements for starting the module (if any).

> **Note:** You can click on the heart icon to add a module to your favorite "i.e. `To-Do`" list, which can be accessed from the [Dashboard](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard).

### Types of Modules
- HTB Academy modules are categorized into: `Offensive`, `Defensive`, and `General` modules. 
- They are also rated based on their difficulty, as: `Fundamental`, `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
- You can filter modules based on the above categories (and other criteria) in the [Modules](https://academy.hackthebox.com/modules) page. 
- Furthermore, you can filter modules by name to find the exact module you are looking for.


### Module Tiers
- Modules are split into `5 Tiers` based on their cost, as follows:
![[Screenshot_20241107_135521.png]]
- Each module costs a specific `amount of cubes` to unlock, and will always `return 20% of those cubes` back upon 100% completion of the module.
- `Tier 0` modules are considered `free modules`, as they cost 10 cubes and reward back 10 cubes, thus not affecting your remaining cubes balance. 
- Remember, `you must complete the module` to gain back the cubes, which is done to incentivize students to complete each module.
- The `Tier` of a module does not reflect its `difficulty`.

> **Note:** If you have an annual subscription, then included modules will cost you 0 cubes, while still giving you back their reward.


### Completing a Module
- To complete a module, you need to solve all of its exercises and mark all sections as "completed". 
- Once that's done, you will usually face the module's `Skills Assessment`, which represents a real-world scenario of the topic the module covered, and tests your understanding of most/all of the skills shown within it.
- If you are able to complete the module's skills assessment, then you will have demonstrated that you have a solid understanding of the module's content, and can thus move to your next module. 
- To do so, simply click on the `Finish` button found at the last section in the module (often the Skills Assessment section).
- When you finish a module, you will be redirected to its `Completion` page. Here, you can `share your achievement` on social media, `write a review for the module`, and find suggestions for modules to do next. You will also unlock the `module's badge`, which you can find on the [My Badges](https://academy.hackthebox.com/my-badges) page.


### Questions
- This module is a tier 0 "free" module. What is the total cubes that will be rewarded back to you by completing it?
