- In HTB Academy, we break the material into digestible chunks to enable a seamless understanding of the content. 
- The largest learning block is a `path`, which is broken into multiple `modules`, each of which covers a specific self-contained topic. Modules are further broken down into multiple `sections`.
- Some paths are linked to certifications, which can be obtained after completing their path and `exam`.

- While a major step, like a path, `may look intimidating` and heavy with information, breaking it into modules and sections `makes it much more digestible and easier to learn`. 
- This allows anyone to start with a single section, and take small steps until they reach their major achievement by obtaining a certificate.

- This process not only allows you to `take it one step at a time`, but also ensures that you are `constantly testing your knowledge and challenging your skills`, which is necessary to reaffirm the knowledge gained through modules and turn it into gained skills.
