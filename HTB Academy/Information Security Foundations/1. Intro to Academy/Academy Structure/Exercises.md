### What is an Exercise?
- Way to test knowledge using a certain target
- Two types of targets: Docker, VM
- Only one target per user can be active at any one time.

### Docker Targets
- Most exercises, especially those with web related topics, use Docker targets.
- They are much faster to spawn and are easily accessible without additional setup needed.
- You are able to access the target using its IP/PORT listed once its booted.
- No VPN connection is required for Docker target access

### VM Targets
- Use for modules that have more advanced requirements for their exercises
	- I.E Active Directory Windows target or a network environment target
- Can be spawned similarly to Docker targets, but take much longer to start up.
- Must be accessed using the VPN, which you can download from your settings or use the already provided workstation

### Completing an Exercise
- Some have hints available for you to help you in the right direction
- Submit your answer once you have complete the exercise/question
- Solving it rewards you the noted amount of cubes
- Some are optional exercises that allow the user to complete the module without completing them

### Questions
- Start the above target, copy the shown IP:PORT by clicking on them, and then paste them in your browser. What's the proof shown in the page?
