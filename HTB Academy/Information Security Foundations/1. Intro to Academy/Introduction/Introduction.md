### Welcome to HTB Academy
- Hack The Box Academy's goal is to provide a `highly interactive` and streamlined learning process to allow users to have fun while learning. 
- The content is based on a `guided learning` approach, and enables you to practice what they learn through interactive content.
- You will face many `hands-on exercises` to reproduce what was covered in the section, as well as challenge your understanding of the content by tackling new scenarios of the same concept.
- Most HTB Academy modules also culminate in a `Skills Assessment` that tests your understanding of the whole module with a real-world scenario.
