**Importance of Knowledge**
- Understanding both Windows and Linux operating systems is crucial for penetration testers.
- Most systems encountered during assessments, whether on-premise or in the cloud, are based on these two operating systems.
- Itâ€™s essential to know how to attack and defend these systems and utilize them for further penetration testing activities.

**Getting System Information with PowerShell**
- **Command**: `Get-WmiObject -Class win32_OperatingSystem | select Version,BuildNumber`
    - Example Output:
        - Version: 10.0.19041
        - BuildNumber: 19041

**Useful WMI Classes**
- **Win32_Process**: Lists processes.
- **Win32_Service**: Lists services.
- **Win32_Bios**: Provides BIOS information.

**Accessing Windows**
- **Local Access**: Using a keyboard, mouse, or other input devices directly connected to the computer.
- **Remote Access**: Accessing a computer over a network.

**Remote Access Technologies**
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Network.
- **SSH**: Secure Shell.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol.
- **VNC**: Virtual Network Computing.
- **WinRM**: Windows Remote Management (PowerShell Remoting).
- **RDP**: Remote Desktop Protocol.


### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
**Overview**
- **Architecture**: Client/server model. Client specifies target IP or hostname.
- **Default Port**: 3389.
- **Usage**: Connect to a Windows target from both Windows and Linux hosts.

**Connecting Using RDP**
- **Windows Client**: Use Remote Desktop Connection (`mstsc.exe`).
    - Allows saving connection profiles for convenience.

**Using xfreerdp**
- **Command**: `xfreerdp /v:<targetIp> /u:htb-student /p:Password`
- **Features**: Drive redirection, file transfer, command-line options.
- **Other Clients**: Remmina, rdesktop. Experiment with different clients to find the best fit.

**Example Command**
- **Connect to Windows Target**:
```
xfreerdp /v:<targetIp> /u:htb-student /p:Password
```
- Note: Target instance may take 1-2 minutes to spawn.
