**Common Terminology**
1. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
    - **Definition**: The Internet.
    - **Characteristics**: Connects multiple LANs. Identified by WAN-specific routing protocols like BGP and IP schemas outside RFC 1918 (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
    - **Internal WAN**: Also called Intranet or Airgap Network, used by large organizations or government agencies.
2. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
    - **Definition**: Internal networks (e.g., home or office networks).
    - **Characteristics**: Uses IP addresses designated for local use (RFC 1918 ranges).
3. **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**
    - **Definition**: Internal networks accessible over Wi-Fi.
    - **Characteristics**: Similar to LAN but wireless. Security considerations are similar to LANs.
4. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
    - **Definition**: Connects multiple network sites to create a unified network.
    - **Types**:
        - **Site-To-Site VPN**: Connects entire networks (e.g., company branches) over the Internet.
        - **Remote Access VPN**: Creates a virtual interface on the clientâ€™s computer. Examples include OpenVPN with TUN adapters. Can be Split-Tunnel (only routes specific networks) or Full-Tunnel (all traffic routes through VPN).
        - **SSL VPN**: Runs within a web browser, allowing access to applications or desktop sessions (e.g., HackTheBox Pwnbox).


**Book Terms**
1. **Global Area Network (GAN)**
    - **Definition**: Worldwide network, including the Internet and international corporate networks.
    - **Characteristics**: Uses wide-area network infrastructure, including undersea cables or satellite transmission.
2. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
    - **Definition**: Regional network connecting several LANs within a city or metropolitan area.
    - **Characteristics**: Uses high-performance connections and routers. Provides faster data throughput compared to the Internet.
3. **Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)**
    - **Definition**: Personal network using wireless technologies like Bluetooth.
    - **Characteristics**: Typically extends a few meters. Examples include Piconet. Used for low data rate applications in IoT.
4. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
    - **Definition**: Network established with cables to connect personal devices.
    - **Characteristics**: Usually extends only a few meters. Useful for device-to-device communication within close proximity.

**Additional Notes**
- **Security Considerations**:
    - **WAN**: Ensure proper use of routing protocols and IP schema.
    - **LAN/WLAN**: Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
    - **VPN**: Be aware of routing tables and potential security implications.
    - **Printer Networks**: Printers should be isolated to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information.
