### Key Information Technology Terminology
Information Technology (IT) encompasses a vast array of terms, protocols, and technologies. Below is a foundational list of essential protocols and their descriptions. This list is a starting point and can be expanded as you encounter new technologies.

**Protocols and Their Descriptions:**
- **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)**: A security protocol for securing wireless networks. It is now considered insecure.
- **Secure Shell (SSH)**: A secure protocol for logging into and executing commands on a remote system.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: Used for transferring files between systems over a network.
- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: A protocol for sending and receiving emails.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: A client-server protocol for sending and receiving data over the internet.
- **Server Message Block (SMB)**: Used for sharing files, printers, and other resources in a network.
- **Network File System (NFS)**: Allows access to files over a network.
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**: Manages network devices.
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)**: A wireless security protocol that uses a password to protect networks.
- **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)**: A security protocol for wireless networks, less secure than WPA.
- **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**: Synchronizes the timing of computers on a network.
- **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)**: Segments a network into multiple logical networks.
- **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)**: A Layer 2 protocol for managing VLANs across switches.
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: A distance-vector routing protocol used in LANs and WANs.
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**: An IGP for routing traffic within a single Autonomous System (AS).
- **Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)**: Cisco's proprietary protocol for routing within autonomous systems.
- **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)**: An advanced distance-vector protocol for routing IP traffic within a network.
- **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**: An encryption program for securing emails, files, and data.
- **Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)**: Used for distributing and retrieving messages in newsgroups.
- **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)**: Cisco's proprietary protocol for discovering and managing Cisco devices.
- **Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)**: Provides redundancy in Cisco routers in case of device failure.
- **Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)**: Automatically assigns available IP routers to hosts.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Ensures a loop-free topology in Layer 2 Ethernet networks.
- **Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS)**: Centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for network access.
- **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)**: A signaling protocol for establishing and terminating real-time voice, video, and multimedia sessions.
- **Voice Over IP (VOIP)**: Technology for making telephone calls over the internet.
- **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)**: A framework supporting multiple authentication methods.
- **Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)**: A Cisco proprietary wireless authentication protocol.
- **Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)**: Provides an encrypted tunnel for wireless and other networks.
- **Systems Management Server (SMS)**: Manages networks, systems, and mobile devices.
- **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)**: Detects potential security vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
- **Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)**: Industrial control system for monitoring and controlling industrial processes.
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: Creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet.
- **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)**: Provides secure, encrypted communication over a network, commonly used in VPNs.
- **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)**: Creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for remote access.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Allows multiple devices on a private network to use a single public IP address.
- **Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF)**: Indicates the end of a line and start of a new one in text files.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)**: Technique for creating dynamic web pages using JavaScript and XML/JSON.
- **Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI)**: Creates performance-oriented web extensions for servers.
- **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: Syntax to identify a resource on the internet.
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: A subset of URI that identifies a web page or resource on the internet.
- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**: Sets up secure connections and authentication for VPNs.
- **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**: Encapsulates data within a VPN tunnel.
- **Remote Shell (RSH)**: Executes commands and programs on a remote computer under Unix.
