### TCP/IP Model Overview
**Definition**:
- **TCP/IP**: Stands for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).
- **Also Known As**: Internet Protocol Suite.

**Layered Structure**:
- **Network Layer (Layer 3)**:
    - **Protocol**: Internet Protocol (IP).
    - **Function**: Handles routing and addressing of data packets.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**:
    - **Protocol**: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    - **Function**: Manages end-to-end communication, data segmentation, and error handling.

**Purpose**:
- **TCP/IP Model**: Provides the framework for communication over the Internet and other networks.
- **Protocols**: Essential for data transmission and network operations, with IP responsible for addressing and routing, and TCP managing reliable data transfer.

### TCP/IP Model vs. OSI Model
**TCP/IP Model**:
- **Functionality**: Facilitates data transfer and exchange over any network regardless of the receiver's location.
- **Key Protocols**:
    - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Ensures data packets reach their destination.
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Manages data transfer, ensuring a reliable connection between the data stream and the application.

**Differences from OSI Model**:
- **Layer Count**: TCP/IP has fewer layers compared to the OSI model.
- **Layer Combination**: Some functions in TCP/IP are combined into fewer layers compared to the OSI model's more detailed layer separation.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **TCP/IP**: Practical for real-world data exchange over networks, focusing on application data handling and transmission.
- **OSI Model**: Provides a more detailed framework with seven distinct layers for understanding network communication and processes.
