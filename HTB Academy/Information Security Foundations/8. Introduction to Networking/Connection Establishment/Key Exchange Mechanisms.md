Key exchange methods are crucial for securely exchanging cryptographic keys between two parties, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communication. Here are some commonly used methods:

#### Diffie-Hellman (DH)
- **Overview**: Allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key without prior communication.
- **Strengths**:
    - Provides a way to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
    - Commonly used in protocols like TLS.
- **Limitations**:
    - Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if not combined with authentication.
    - Computationally intensive, which can be impractical for low-power devices.

#### Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)
- **Overview**: Uses the properties of large prime numbers for key exchange.
- **Strengths**:
    - Widely used for encrypting data and digital signatures.
    - Integral to protocols like SSL/TLS and authentication systems.
- **Applications**:
    - Encrypting and signing messages.
    - Protecting data in transit.
    - Generating and verifying digital signatures.
    - Authenticating users and devices.
- **Limitations**:
    - Computationally intensive, which can impact performance.

#### Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
- **Overview**: A variant of DH using elliptic curve cryptography.
- **Strengths**:
    - More efficient and secure compared to traditional DH.
    - Provides forward secrecy, ensuring past communications remain confidential.
    - Used in TLS and VPN protocols.
- **Applications**:
    - Establishing secure communication channels.
    - Authenticating users and devices in protocols like IKE.

#### Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
- **Overview**: Uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate digital signatures.
- **Strengths**:
    - Provides enhanced security and efficiency for digital signature generation.
- **Applications**:
    - Authenticating the parties in key exchanges.
    - Digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity.

#### Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
- **Overview**: A protocol for establishing and maintaining secure communication sessions, especially in VPNs.
- **Strengths**:
    - Combines Diffie-Hellman and other cryptographic techniques.
    - Used to negotiate security parameters and securely exchange keys.
- **Modes**:
    - **Main Mode**: Default, considered more secure with a three-phase key exchange process.
    - **Aggressive Mode**: Faster performance with a two-phase key exchange, but less secure due to reduced identity protection.
- **Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)**:
    - **Overview**: A secret value shared between parties to authenticate and establish a shared secret.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Adds an additional layer of security through mutual authentication.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Difficult to exchange securely.
        - Vulnerable to MITM attacks if not properly protected.
