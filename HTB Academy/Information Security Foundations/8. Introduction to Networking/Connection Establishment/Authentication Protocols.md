### Key Points on Authentication Protocols in Networking
1. **Purpose of Authentication Protocols**:
    - Provide a secure and standardized way to verify identities of users, devices, and entities in a network.
    - Essential for secure information exchange, maintaining confidentiality, and preventing unauthorized access.
2. **Common Authentication Protocols**:
    - **Kerberos**: Uses a Key Distribution Center (KDC) and tickets for authentication in domain environments.
    - **SRP (Secure Remote Password)**: Password-based protocol with cryptographic protections against eavesdropping and MITM attacks.
    - **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: Cryptographic protocol for secure communication.
    - **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Successor to SSL, providing communication security over the internet.
    - **OAuth**: Allows third-party access to user web resources without sharing passwords.
    - **OpenID**: Decentralized protocol for using a single identity to sign into multiple sites.
    - **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
    - **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: Verifies identity with two different authentication factors.
    - **FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)**: An alliance creating standards for strong authentication.
    - **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**: System for secure information exchange using public/private keys and digital signatures.
    - **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Uses one set of credentials to access multiple applications.
    - **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Uses multiple factors (password, device, biometrics) for identity verification.
    - **PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)**: Sends passwords in clear text; considered insecure.
    - **CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)**: Uses a three-way handshake for authentication.
    - **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**: Supports multiple authentication methods.
    - **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Secure network protocol for remote command execution and file transfer, with encryption.
    - **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP for encrypted communication, using SSL/TLS.
    - **LEAP (Lightweight EAP)**: Wireless protocol by Cisco, now largely deprecated due to vulnerabilities.
    - **PEAP (Protected EAP)**: Secure tunneling protocol using TLS for encrypted communication in wired/wireless networks.
3. **Comparison of LEAP and PEAP**:
    - **LEAP**: Uses the weaker RC4 encryption and is vulnerable to dictionary attacks; replaced by more secure protocols.
    - **PEAP**: More secure, uses TLS for encryption and server authentication, supports stronger algorithms like AES and 3DES.
4. **SSL/TLS-Based Protocols**:
    - **SSH** and **HTTPS**: Use strong encryption and digital certificates to protect authentication information from interception or tampering.
