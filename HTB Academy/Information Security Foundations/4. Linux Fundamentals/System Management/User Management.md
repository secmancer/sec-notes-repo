User management is a key aspect of Linux administration. It involves creating, modifying, and deleting users and groups, as well as executing commands with different user privileges.

#### Executing Commands as a Different User
- **Example**:
```
Attempt to access a restricted file:

secmancer@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/shadow
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied


Using `sudo` to gain elevated privileges:

secmancer@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat /etc/shadow
root:<SNIP>:18395:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:17737:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:17737:0:99999:7:::
<SNIP>
```
