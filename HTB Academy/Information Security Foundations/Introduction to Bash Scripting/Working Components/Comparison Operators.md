- To compare specific values with each other, we need elements that are called [comparison operators](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html). The `comparison operators` are used to determine how the defined values will be compared. For these operators, we differentiate between:
	- `string` operators
	- `integer` operators
	- `file` operators
	- `boolean` operators


## String Operators
- If we compare strings, then we know what we would like to have in the corresponding value.

- It is important to note here that we put the variable for the given argument (`$1`) in double-quotes (`"$1"`). This tells Bash that the content of the variable should be handled as a string. Otherwise, we would get an error.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check the given argument
if [ "$1" != "HackTheBox" ]
then
	echo -e "You need to give 'HackTheBox' as argument."
	exit 1

elif [ $# -gt 1 ]
then
	echo -e "Too many arguments given."
	exit 1

else
	domain=$1
	echo -e "Success!"
fi
```
- String comparison operators "`<` / `>`" works only within the double square brackets `[[ <condition> ]]`. We can find the ASCII table on the Internet or by using the following command in the terminal. We take a look at an example later.
```shell-session
secmancer@htb[/htb]$ man ascii
```

- `ASCII` stands for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange` and represents a 7-bit character encoding. Since each bit can take two values, there are `128` different bit patterns, which can also be interpreted as the decimal integers `0` - `127` or in hexadecimal values `00` - `7F`. The first 32 ASCII character codes are reserved as so-called [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character).



## Integer Operators
- Comparing integer numbers can be very useful for us if we know what values we want to compare. Accordingly, we define the next steps and commands how the script should handle the corresponding value.
![[Screenshot_20241111_152108.png]]
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check the given argument
if [ $# -lt 1 ]
then
	echo -e "Number of given arguments is less than 1"
	exit 1

elif [ $# -gt 1 ]
then
	echo -e "Number of given arguments is greater than 1"
	exit 1

else
	domain=$1
	echo -e "Number of given arguments equals 1"
fi
```


## File Operators
- The file operators are useful if we want to find out specific permissions or if they exist.
![[Screenshot_20241111_152136.png]]
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the specified file exists
if [ -e "$1" ]
then
	echo -e "The file exists."
	exit 0

else
	echo -e "The file does not exist."
	exit 2
fi
```


## Boolean and Logical Operators
- We get a boolean value "`false`" or "`true`" as a result with logical operators. Bash gives us the possibility to compare strings by using double square brackets `[[Â <condition> ]]`. To get these boolean values, we can use the string operators. Whether the comparison matches or not, we get the boolean value "`false`" or "`true`".
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check the boolean value
if [[ -z $1 ]]
then
	echo -e "Boolean value: True (is null)"
	exit 1

elif [[ $# > 1 ]]
then
	echo -e "Boolean value: True (is greater than)"
	exit 1

else
	domain=$1
	echo -e "Boolean value: False (is equal to)"
fi
```


## Logical Operators
- With logical operators, we can define several conditions within one. This means that all the conditions we define must match before the corresponding code can be executed.
![[Screenshot_20241111_152207.png]]
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the specified file exists and if we have read permissions
if [[ -e "$1" && -r "$1" ]]
then
	echo -e "We can read the file that has been specified."
	exit 0

elif [[ ! -e "$1" ]]
then
	echo -e "The specified file does not exist."
	exit 2

elif [[ -e "$1" && ! -r "$1" ]]
then
	echo -e "We don't have read permission for this file."
	exit 1

else
	echo -e "Error occured."
	exit 5
fi
```



## Exercise Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

var="8dm7KsjU28B7v621Jls"
value="ERmFRMVZ0U2paTlJYTkxDZz09Cg"

for i in {1..40}
do
        var=$(echo $var | base64)
		
		#<---- If condition here:
done
```


## Questions
- Create an "If-Else" condition in the "For"-Loop that checks if the variable named "var" contains the contents of the variable named "value". Additionally, the variable "var" must contain more than 113,450 characters. If these conditions are met, the script must then print the last 20 characters of the variable "var". Submit these last 20 characters as the answer.
