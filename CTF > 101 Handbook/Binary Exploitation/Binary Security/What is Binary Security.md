Some methods covered include:

- [No eXecute (NX)](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/no-execute/)
- [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/address-space-layout-randomization/)
- [Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/relocation-read-only/)
- [Stack Canaries/Cookies](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/)
